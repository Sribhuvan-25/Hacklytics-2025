1. Write down your income.,"A budget is just a customized plan for your money where you decide—beforeeach month begins—how much you’re going to give, save and spend. So the first step to making a budget is figuring out how much money you have to start with. Add up the money you’ll have coming in during the upcoming month from all sources—including what you’ll make from your day job,side hustles, any scholarships that are paid to you directly, and any cash you’ll get from your parents. (Make sure you thank your folks if they give your bank account a lift.) If your income changes month to month and you don’t know exact numbers yet, that’s no problem—just make your best guess. Once you’ve got all the numbers, write them down on your budget. Here’s what that could look like:  "
2. List your expenses.,"Next, you’ll want to write down everything you spend money on. And I mean everything! To get you started, here are some common monthly expenses that apply to most college students: Now, that list is a great starting point, but you may have some other expenses that aren’t on it. So, look back at your recent bank statements or receipts and think about everything you spend money on. You don’t want anything to sneak up on you down the road—even your weekly stop at the donut shop. Once you’ve organized your budget categories, plan how much you’ll spend for each one. Personally, I put giving and saving at the top of my list to keep my priorities in check. Then I move on to the other categories. Some expenses that cost the same each month, like Netflix and rent, are easy to plan for. Others, like food and transportation, are more unpredictable. To make those easier, look at what you spentlastmonth in each category and use that as a guide."
3. Subtract your expenses from your income.,"Once you’ve assigned a dollar amount to every category, it’s time to whip out your calculator. If you’re anything like me, you’re ready to dip once math is mentioned. But hang on—I promise this isn’t complicated at all. All you need to do is add up the expenses you just listed, including what you plan to give, save and spend. Then, subtract that total from your income. You want that number to be a big fatzero. Why? Because azero-based budget, where your income minus your expenses equals zero, is theonlytype of budget that works in the long haul. It means giving every single dollar a job. So, if your total expenses arelessthan your income, give that leftover money something to do—maybe you add it to savings or give it to a cause you care about. And if your total expenses aremorethan your income, you have two great options:increasing your income(trust me, there are plenty of ways to make extra money in college) or cutting back on your expenses (we’ll go over some tips on how to do that a little bit later). Here’s what your budget might look like with the example income we used in the first step. "
4. Track your spending.,"Once you get to this point, you’ve officially made your first college student budget. Let’s go! Give yourself a minute to celebrate this win. But you’re not quite done with the entire process. Turns out, you can’t justmakea budget and expect something to happen—you have tostick to it. The biggest key to sticking to your budget istracking your spendingthroughout the month. If you wait until the end of the month to see if you’re on track, you’re too late!"
How to Cut Back on College Expenses,"If you need to free up some room in your budget, cutting back on spending is an easy way to make that happen. Here are some of my favorite tips forsaving money in collegeand how you can lower your monthly expenses."
How to Save Money on Tuition,"There’s a tried and true way to cut back on tuition costs that every student should take advantage of:scholarships.But I’m already in college. Isn’t it too late for me to get scholarships?No! Plenty of scholarships are available, especially for students already enrolled in college. So start looking for ones you’d qualify for and apply to as many as you can."
How to Save Money on Food,"A lot of colleges require meal plans if you live on campus. If that’s you, try getting as much bang for your buck as possible. Eating in the cafeteria isn’t as fun as running to Taco Bell or Chick-fil-A, but try to avoid eating at restaurants as much as possible. I know some cafeteria food has the nutritional value of Play-Doh, but youcanfind good options. And you’re already paying for it, so you might as well get your money’s worth. If you don’t have a meal plan, trybuying groceriesand eating at home more often than eating out. That’ll save you atonof money in the long run."
How to Save Money on Textbooks,"Shopping at your school’s bookstore may be the easiest and most convenient way to buy books, but it’snotthe cheapest. You can get used books for a lot less on sites like Chegg, eBay or Amazon. (Just make sure you purchase the right version.) You can also save some money by renting books instead of buying them."
How to Save Money on Entertainment,"Your college probably offers a lot of free entertainment—like clubs, intramural sports, concerts and more. Ask older students for some ways to have fun on campus without reaching into your wallet. (Just make sure your “entertainment” doesn’t involve something that would get the police called . . .) You can also cut back on your entertainment budget by cutting down on the music and TVstreaming servicesyou pay for. Do you reallyneed Netflix, Hulu, HBO MaxandDisney+? Nope, and you can also choose from tons offree streaming services."
How to Save Money on Housing,"Deciding on the best plan for college housing can be tricky. Sometimes, on-campus housing is the most affordable option. Other times,finding a roommateand renting an apartment off campus is your best bet. Do your research and figure out which choice is the most affordable—and make sure your “bargain” apartment isn’t full of bedbugs and broken dreams. No thank you. By the way, if you do live on campus, becoming a resident assistant (aka an RA) is a great way to save money on housing. RAs monitor the dorms and help with student activities, and in exchange, they typically get discounted housinganda cash stipend on top of that."
Get It Done!,"Here’s the cold, hard truth: If you don’t have a budget, you’re not in control of your money. A budget is a game plan, and youlosethe game when you don’t have one. I don’t want that for you—I want you to win. And don’t wait to get started!Oh, I’ll make a budget right after I finish that sociology paper and eat my grilled cheese.Child, please. You and I both know that’s not going to happen. Do it now! "

1. Identify your spending tendencies.,"If you want to learn how to not spend money, you need to start with yourmoney mindset. It’s important to know your spending tendencies (or as I call them,spendencies). Are you naturally wired to be a spender or a saver? Are you a nerd or a free spirit? Do you value safety or status? All these factors and more can directly influence yourspending habits. And the more aware you are of your spending temptations, the more likely you are to guard yourself against them."
2. Create a budget.,"Abudgetis thekeyto fighting overspending. Because if you have a spending plan for the month ahead, you’re more likely to stay on track. Start by listing your monthly income, followed by all yourmonthly expenses. Be sure to include the basics (starting with food, utilities, housing and transportation)beforeyou budget for things like entertainment or clothing. Then subtract your expenses from your income. The goal is for this number to equal zero—this is called azero-based budget. You want to make sure every single dollar you make goes toward giving, saving, spending or paying off debt.A zero-based budget is how you get your spending under control. If you’ve never budgeted before, you might be surprised by how much money you’re spending each week (or even each month) on little things—like coffee, lunches or that snack shop at work that your spouse doesn’t know about. And give yourself some grace. It usually takes a few months to make your budget work for you. Then you can keep fine-tuning your budget to cut costs and trim down your spending even more."
3. Set money goals.,"Having a specificmoney goalyou’re working toward is a great way to motivate yourself to stop spending money. Because every dollar you spend is one less dollar you can put toward the bigger thing you want. Your goal could be to pay off debt, save for a car, or go on a debt-free vacation. Whatever it is, make itspecific. Even better if you have a visual reminder you can put on your fridge or in your wallet. That way, every time you’re tempted to buy something, you have to decide if it’s worth delaying your goal for."
4. Track your spending.,"It doesn’t matter how large (or small) your income is—if you’re not tracking your spending, you’ll never be in control of your money. In fact, you’ll always feel like your money is controllingyou. And while making a budget is important, you also have tostickto your budget bytracking your expensesthroughout the month. Every single expense. This will help you know how much you have left to spend. Plus, it makes you more aware of where your money is actually going."
5. Do a no-spend challenge.,"Want to know the best way to stop spending money? Doing ano-spend challenge! This is where you commit to only buying the bare necessities for a certain period of time. And hey, this is actually more fun than it may sound. Challenging yourself to spend as little as possible for an entire month forces you to be super intentional with your spending. Plus, it helps you see what you can actually live without."
6. Avoid restaurants (and food delivery apps).,"One of the biggest areas we overspend on is food. We all know thateating outgets expensive—fast. If you’re spending $15 on lunch five times a week, that’s $75 a week (and $300 a month). And don’t even get me started on food delivery app fees! Deciding to cut out (or at least cutback) on eating out is a huge way to keep yourself from spending too much money. I’m not saying you shouldn’t ever treat yourself to Sunday brunch or a nice dinner on a special occasion—just scale it back some and make sure it’s in the budget."
7. Plan your meals.,"Speaking of not eating out,planning your mealsin advance can help you lower your overall food costs. And it doesn’t have to be complicated! Choose a couple of recipes for the week, head to the store with your list, and set aside some time to prep or cook your meals. Then the next time you’re tempted to hit up the drive-thru after a long day, you can say, “We’ve got food at home!”"
8. Use the envelope system.,"One way to keep yourself from overspending is to use thecash envelope system. Here’s how it works: You choose specific budget lines (like groceries, gas, personal), label individual envelopes with those lines, and then put cash (yes,physicalcash) into each envelope. The envelope system is helpful for a couple reasons: 1) You tend to spend lesswhen you use cashthan when you use a card, and 2) you can only spend what you’ve budgeted in your envelope. When the money is gone, it’s gone! It’s a great way to keep you disciplined with your spending. "
9. Swear off debt.,"If you really want to stop spending money you don’t have, you need to swear offborrowingmoney (aka debt). The truth is, debt steals your income. One purchase you make today can keep you trapped in payments (and interest) for months or years to come. Your debtownsyou until you pay it off. Here’s the deal: If you don’t have the cash to pay for something right now, you can’t really afford it. So, if you’re serious about getting your spending under control, go ahead andcancel your credit cards. Take debt completely off the table. Because without credit, overspending isn’t even an option!"
10. Find alternatives to retail therapy.,"We may sometimes joke about being a shopaholic, but compulsive spending, otherwise known asretail therapy, is a real thing. We buy something because we want itnow. We add it to our cart before we think about what’s in the checking account (or before considering our financial goals, for that matter). But instant gratification isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Spending money doesn’t actually make you feel better . . . especially when you see your bank account shrinking right before your eyes. So, instead of trying to spend your feelings away, work out what youremotions are really telling you. Or find other things you can do besides spend money: Move your body, talk to a friend, or do a task you’ve been putting off."
11. Resist sales.,"Who doesn’t love a good deal? I know I do! Retailers know how tolure their customerswith a flashy (and perfectly placed) sales rack. But how much is all this saving reallycostingyou? If you buy a sweater you were never going to buy just because it’s 25% off, you’re actually paying 100%morethan you would have. So, if you see an item on sale that you weren’t already planning to get, it wasn’t meant to be (preaching to myself here too). And if you can’t stop thinking about something, add it to your budget for next month (most likely, there’ll beanothersale)."
12. Limit social media comparison.,"Picture this: It’s Saturday morning, and before you realize it, you’re scrolling through your social media feed to catch up on what your friends are up to. Not even two swipes in, you’re bombarded with a post of an influencer making their morning latte—complete with a high-end coffee machine, aesthetic mug and expensive milk frother. Suddenly you’re thinking,Wait, maybemymornings would be better if I had that espresso machine. Social media makesthe comparison gameeven more intense. Your friend’s post about their brand-new couch with those perfect throw pillows. That popular blogger’s reel about the incredible, all-inclusive resort she went to. It can make us feel like our lives aren’t good enough and we need to spend more money to reach their level. But all that does is drain our bank accounts and steal our joy. A good question to ask yourself:Would I still want this if no one else ever sees it?You can also cut the comparison by unfollowing those accounts (you know the ones) or limiting your social media use altogether. Trust me, you’ll feel a whole lot lighter!"
13. Shop with a list.,"We’ve all been there. You make a quick run to Target to get toothpaste and peanut butter. But as soon as you walk through the door, you feel the gravitational pull toward the dollar spot and the clothes section. Just like that, a quick trip to the store for two essentials just gotprettyexpensive. Consider this: Instead of heading into a store and wandering up and down the aisles, make a list ahead of time and carry it with you into the store to keep you on track. And if you get caught in theimpulse buyscenario a lot, try to avoid the stores that make you spend too much money. (Or maybe send your spouse in for you.)"
14. Pause before you spend.,"If you’re still having trouble sticking to your budget, ask yourself this question before every purchase:When will I use this? Take the time to literally imagine how you’ll be using thatmust-haveitem a month from now. Will that sweater hold up after a few washes? Will your kids still be playing with that overpriced toy set? Will those shoes go with more than one outfit? Most of the time, the answer is no. Put it back and save yourself thebuyer’s remorse. Otherwise, make it a rule to wait at least 24 hours. By that point, if you still love it and you can fit it into your budget, go ahead and get it."
15. Use what you already have.,"It’s crazy how much money we waste buying things we really don’t need—especially when we already have things at home that get the job done. We eye the beautiful, mint green Kitchen Aid mixer when our own mixer works perfectly well. We think we need a new skin care set when we have a whole basket of unused products under the sink. Before you add an item to your shopping list, take inventory and see what you already own. Also, what can you repurpose, fix or even borrow from a friend? Instead of buying décor, shop your house and rearrange a room for a fresh look. Rather than spend money on a toy for your kid, pull out board games or unused coloring books. Making use of what you already have will save you money and help you practicecontentment."
16. Find someone to hold you accountable.,"It’s one thing to say you’ll stop spending money, but many of us need someone to help us stay on track. Whether it’s a spouse, a friend or even a group chat, tell someone your goal and ask them to check in with you every week or every month. Maybe your accountability is afinancial coach—an expert who can help you navigate your situation and help you get to the root of your overspending. Knowing that you’ll have to report your progress to someone else motivates you to make more of an effort. And remember, no matter how the next month goes, it’s never too late to change your spending habits. You can always adjustyour budgetand get back on track at any point. You’ve got this!"

What Is a 401(k) Student Loan Match?,"A 401(k) student loan matchallows companies to offer 401(k) matches based on their employees’ student loan payments.This programalso works with403(b),457(b), andSIMPLE IRAplans.1 Until earlier this year, employers offering a401(k) matchcould only make contributions to your retirement accounts ifyouwere also contributing. Now, companies can offer matches based on the amount you pay toward a student loan, rather than what you contribute to your 401(k). Technically, this whole shebang started when former President Joe Biden signed theSECURE 2.0 Actinto law back in 2022. But the IRS only began providing guidance for companies interested in implementing this program in 2024.2 Sidenote: It’s not a requirementfor employers to offer a student loan match—it’s just a newoption. So don’t feel like you’re getting cheated if your company doesn’t offer this."
How Does a SECURE 2.0 Student Loan Match Work?,"Let’s look at an example to see how this works. We’ll say you make $60,000 and your employer offers a 4% match on your401(k)contributions, which comes out to $200 a month. Until now, the only way for you to get that $200 was to contribute at least $200 of your own income into your employer-sponsored retirement account. Then your employer would match that contribution by also putting in $200. But with this new rule, employers have the option of matching yourstudent loanpayments—not just your retirement contributions. So, if you had that same 4% match on a $60,000 salary and you made a student loan payment of at least $200, your employer couldstillput $200 in your 401(k)—even though you didn’t contribute a dime. Pretty wild. If your employer chooses to offer a student loan match, getting signed up should be as simple as filling out a few online forms. You may also be asked to provide some documentation, like proof of your student loan payments."
Student Loan 401(k) Match Pros and Cons,"This program definitely soundslike a great deal if you’ve got student loans, but does it hold up when you look at it under a microscope? For the most part, yes. Let’s go over the pros and cons."
Should You Take Advantage of a Student Loan Match?,"If your employer offers a student loan 401(k) match, I don’t have a problem with you taking advantage of it. But before you run off to HR and sign up, here are three important warnings."
1. Pause retirement investing outside of your match.,"Remember: This benefit only works out because it lets you double dip by putting all your extra money toward debt while still getting some drops in the retirement bucket. (It’s also the only time you should double dip—let’s not be feral with the communal guac. Have some class.) So, keep your own contributions paused and focus all your financial energy on getting out of debt. You can contribute for yourself once you’re debt-free."
2. Don’t let a student loan match slow down your debt payoff.,"Like we already talked about, the only way to get out of debt is to attack it with a vengeance. That means you’re not going on vacation, eating out, upgrading your car, or buying matching workout sets from Lululemon. (Sorry, you’ll have to get the Amazon dupe like the rest of us.) Seriously, you want to get out of debt ASAP so you can start investingandhave way more margin to do so. So, don’t let this little bonus cause you to lose your sense of urgency."
3. Start investing 15% of your income once you’re debt-free with a fully funded emergency fund.,"Getting an employer match while you’re paying off your student loans is cool, but it’s not enough to make much of a long-term difference in your retirement savings. So, once your debt is gone and you have a fully fundedemergency fundof 3–6 months of expenses, it’s time to focus on the future instead of paying for the past. How much should you invest at that point? I recommend setting your monthlyinvestment contributionfor 15% of your income."
The Bottom Line,"To sum it all up, the 401(k) student loan match can be a positive development for anyone who uses it correctly and maintains a high level of intensity while paying off debt. Itisfree money, and itisa cool way to make progress on two important financial goals at the same time. Just remember to stay hyperfocused on paying off your student loans as fast as possible. Because once you’re debt-free, that’s when you’ll really be able to start winning with money. "

1. Get on a budget.,"You may not think budgeting can make that big of a difference, but it really is the starting point for paying cash for college. When you don’t make a plan for how you’ll spend your money before the month begins—and don’t track your spending throughout the month—things get chaotic super quickly. After all, if you don’t tell your money where to go, you’ll wind up wondering where it went. On the other hand, making and sticking to a budget every month gives you control. It keeps you from making mindless Amazon orders and impulse Taco Bell runs—which can add up quickly if you aren’t paying much attention to your money. So, if you’ve never made a budget before, change that today! You can’t take full advantage of all these other tips without a budget."
2. Fill out the FAFSA.,"Filling out theFree Application for Federal Student Aid(or FAFSA) is amustif you want to pay for college without student loans. This is the form schools use to figure out how much money they can offer you, plus what kinds of aid you qualify for. No FAFSA means no grants or merit-based scholarships. A few facts to know: Depending on your financial need and the schools you consider, you may be able to cover your education entirely through grants and aid from your state or school. (We’ll talk more about grants and scholarships later.) For now, just remember that all financial aid is awarded only to students whofill out their FAFSA."
3. Choose an affordable school.,"If you were to ask friends or neighbors the most important factor in choosing a school, you’d get all kinds of answers, like the student culture, the size of the dorms, or even the success of the football team. But here’s the truth: When it comes to choosing a school, you need to focus on affordability above all else. At the end of the day, your top priority should be to find a school you can afford. This might mean adjusting your expectations about going to a certain “dream school.” Because graduating with piles of debt isnota dream—it’s a nightmare. When it comes to four-year schools, in-state public colleges are almost always the most affordable option. You may be able to save even more money by attending a “directional” school, which is a regional public university typically named after its geographic location within the state (think schools like Southern Illinois University or Central Michigan University). And keep in mind that the traditional approach to college, where you move away to live on campus for four years, isn’t the only way to get an education. Trade schools and community colleges are great options for plenty of students. (You can even start out at community college before transferring to a four-year school.)"
4. Apply for scholarships.,Scholarships are the most powerful tools for covering school without loans because you never have to pay them back. It’s free money! Here are some tips for getting the most out of scholarships:
5. Take advantage of grants.,"Once again, we’re talking about free money youdon’thave to pay back—which is the only kind of aid you want. Grants are awarded by schools, organizations and federal assistance programs based on your financial need. Once you’ve completed your FAFSA, you’ll learn about thefederal grantsyou’re up for."
6. Earn college credits in high school.,"Taking Advanced Placement (AP) classes as a high schooler lets you get a head start on earning college credit. And since you likely won’t pay more than $100 to take an AP exam, this can make ahugedifference in the cost of attending college. Dual enrollment classes, whichlet you enroll in college courses while you’re still in high school, can also give you a head start on college coursework. Like AP classes, dual enrollment often comes with a significantly reduced cost—or even no cost. You’ll simultaneously earn both high school and college credit for the same class. If your school offers either of these programs and you qualify, take advantage!"
7. Save money ahead of time.,"If you’re reading this as a current college student, then it’s unfortunately too late to tackle this one. (Don’t worry, you can still avoid student loans by following the other tips.) But if youhaven’tstarted college yet, then it’s time to start piling up some cash. Whether you start investingfor college by opening a529 planorEducation Savings Account(ESA), or you simply start setting money aside in asavings account, every little bit helps."
8. Cut your food and supply costs.,"Tuition isn’t the only cost you need to think about cutting as a college student. You can also control the amount you spend each semester on food and class supplies. Think about it: If you go through college eating at restaurants every single night, you’ll wind up wasting loads of cash on food—especially if you’re already required to purchase a meal plan. So, instead of going out, milk that meal plan for all it’s worth and eat at home whenever you’re tired of the cafeteria. And while it may be convenient to order all your books brand new from the campus bookstore, you couldsavehundredsof dollars by shopping around online and getting used books from places like eBay, Amazon and Chegg (just make sure you have the right edition)."
9. Work during college.,"There’s a great place for young people to go when they need money—to work! You might think getting a job will steal too much of your studying time, but tons of working students excel in college each year. Plus, you’ll hone some valuable life skills like time management and work ethic. If you’re looking for a place to start, here are some good options for students looking to work while in school:"
10. Limit housing expenses.,"Aside from tuition, housing is the priciest part of going to college. Luckily, you can cut that cost in several ways. Moral of the story? Don’t just look at the amount your school charges to live in a dorm and assume that’s what you have to pay. You may be able to lower that price tag."
You Can Go to College Debt-Free!,"At the end of the day, just remember that every little effort now sets you up for a debt-free future. And a degree without loans means more freedom to chase your dreams later. So, start planning, stay focused, and crush those college costs—you’ve got this!"

How to Budget as a Single Mom,"Managing your household finances by yourself (on top of everything else) can feel intimidating. But the truth is, you can confidently take control of your money—no matter your income, marital status or financial past. It all starts with a budget. There are a lot of budgeting methods out there, but azero-based budgetis the most helpful. Here’s how it works: Keep in mind, every single-mom budget is going to look different (depending on your income, how many kids you have, and where you live). And if you realize that your expenses aremorethan your income for the month, don’t worry. That’s totally normal when you first budget! But in that case, you’ll need to do some adjusting. Go through your budget and see where you can cut back so you’re not in the red (more on that in a minute). "
11 Effective Budgeting Tips for Single Moms,"Now that we’ve covered the budgeting basics, let’s talk about how to actuallystickto your budget. Here are 11 things you can do to save money as a single mom and feel more in control of your money:"
1. Focus on the Four Walls.,"Don’t be discouraged if your income isn’t where you want it to be right now. You can (andshould) stillbudget with a low income. The most important thing is that you prioritize what we call theFour Walls: food, utilities, shelter and transportation. Plan for those before you budget for anything else. You want to make sure you’ve got enough to feed your kids and yourself, keep the lights on, and put gas in the tank to get to work.If you can at least do those things, you won’t have to stress as much about making it to the end of the month."
2. Find ways to save on essentials.,"Speaking of your Four Walls, let’s talk about how tosave moneyon food, household items and other necessities. Here are some money-saving tips for single moms:"
3. Cut expenses where you can.,We know it’s hard to say no—whether it’s to your kids or to yourself. But every expense adds up! So take a look at your budget and see what spending you can cut. Do you really need all thosestreaming serviceswhen your kids just watch Disney+? Even little treats like lattes and pizza deliveries add up. Decide what you’re willing to live without in order to save more each month. 
4. Adjust your budget as needed.,"Don’t feel like you have to get your budget right immediately. In fact, it usually takes about three months to get the hang of it. If you overspend in some categories, just go into your budget and adjust it as needed throughout the month. Your budget should workforyou, not against you. Start with this month, stick with it, and give yourself some grace."
5. Save for emergencies.,"You get a flat tire on the way to work. Your kid needs a tooth pulled. Emergencies happen—usually at the most inconvenient times. That’s why it’s important to have anemergency fund. If you’re a single parent, the goal is to have about six months of expenses saved up. But if you’ve got debt to pay off, start with $1,000 (this is part of the proven money plan calledthe 7 Baby Steps). Maybe you’ve never even had $1,000 in the bank before. But you cansave $1,000faster than you think! And it’s definitely worth the peace of mind."
6. Increase your income.,"A huge thing you can do to boost your financial situation is toincrease your income. Now, we know that as a single parent, you only have so much time and energy to add more work onto your plate. But there are things you can do to earn more money. Here are some ways for single moms to make more money:"
7. Avoid and pay off debt.,"Thetruth about debt: It keeps you stuck. Stuck paying for the past. Stuck in a defeated state of mind. We understand you may have had to use debt to make ends meet before. But if you follow the tips we’ve already given, you won’t need to rely on credit cards or loans to get by. Decide right now that you’re done with debt. And start taking the steps to pay off any debt you currently have. (Again, you canget out of debteven on a low income.) The best way to make progress is with thedebt snowball—once you knock out that smallest debt, you’ll have unbelievable momentum to keep going!"
8. Consider downsizing or refinancing.,"If your housing budget line is what’s causing you the most stress, considerdownsizinginto a house or apartment you can better afford. We know this can be particularly emotional if you just recently became a single parent and you’re afraid of too much change at once (for both you and your child). But you want your housing situation to be a blessing, not a burden—so do what makes the most sense for your family and your budget. If you have a mortgage, look intorefinancing. It could help lower your payments and give you some breathing room while you take care of other money priorities."
9. Communicate with your kids.,"We understand wanting to protect your children from your own financial worries. But children can sense when you’re stressed or when finances are tight. It’s best to be honest andtalk to your kids about money—in an age-appropriate way, of course. Let them know what your spending priorities are and what you may have to say no to as a family, so they know what to expect. And don’t be afraid to share money goals with your kids. They usually enjoy pitching in, helping you track progress, and celebrating with you when you hit a milestone!"
10. Seek out single-mom resources.,"Listen, there’s no shame in taking advantage of programs and discounts for single parents—that’s what they’re there for! But watch out for loansdisguised as financial help(because remember, you’re avoiding debt).

What Is the Debt Avalanche Method?,"The debt avalanche method (sometimes calleddebt stacking) is a debt-payoff strategy where you pay off your debts in order from highest to lowest interest rate, regardless of the balance. So, let’s say you had a credit card balance of $15,000 at 23% interest and a student loan of $10,000 at 5% interest. According to the avalanche method, you would focus on paying off the credit cardfirstbefore you tackled the student loan. The goal with the debt avalanche method is to save more money in the long run by getting rid of the debts that are charging you the most in interest. But with this strategy, you might have to pay off your largest balances first. And that can feel super intimidating—especially when you’ve still got other debts to pay off!"
How the Debt Avalanche Method Works,"Step 1: List all your debts from highest interest rate to lowest interest rate, regardless of the balance (this includes personal loans, student loans, car notes, credit card balances, medical bills—anything you owe, except your mortgage). Step 2: Attack the debt with the highest interest rate first, while still paying minimum payments on your other debts. Step 3: Once you pay off the debt with the highest interest rate, attack the debt with the next highest interest rate. Step 4: Repeat until you’ve paid off all your debts, ending on the debt with the lowest interest rate."
Debt Avalanche Method Example,"Okay, so now you know how the debt avalanche works. But let’s look at an example of how the avalanche method would play out in real life. In this case, you would start by focusing all your energy on paying off the $20,000 credit card because it has the highest interest rate at 20%. Once you paid off the credit card, you’d move on to the personal loan at 17%—using what you were paying toward the credit card. Then so on and so on, all the way down to the $2,000 car loan at 4% interest. That all makes sense . . .in theory. But is the avalanche method really the bestway to get out of debt? Let’s dive into an alternative method to the debt avalanche—the debt snowball—to see which one is more effective."
Debt Snowball vs. Debt Avalanche,"With thedebt snowball method, you pay off your debt in order from smallest to largest balance, regardless of the interest rate. You attack the smallest debt with everything you’ve got, while making minimum payments on your other debts. When the smallest debt is gone, you move to the next smallest and repeat until you’re debt-free. By paying off yoursmallest debt first(instead of focusing on the interest rate), you get a quick win! Plus, you immediately free up money to tackle the rest of your debt. The debt snowball creates unstoppable momentum to knock out the rest of your debts—like a snowball rolling down a hill! With the debt avalanche method, you may not get a feeling of accomplishment fora long time. That can cause you to lose steam and give up way before you even pay off your first debt. And that’s no good! Sure, it might make sensemathematicallyto begin with the debt that has the highest interest rate, but (let’s get real) if math was the problem, we wouldn’t be in debt in the first place. You need a realistic strategy you can actually stick with. The debt avalanche and debt snowball have a similar goal: to help youget rid of your debt. But you’re more likely to make it happen with the debt snowball. The motivation it gives you is the secret sauce you need to become debt-free once and for all!"
Get Your Debt Snowball Rolling With a Budget,"If the debt snowball is the best (and fastest) way to pay off your debt, then it’s time to get yours rolling! And the best way to do that is with a budget. Abudgetis simply a plan for your money. You give every single dollar a job to do—whether it’s giving, saving, spending or (in this case) paying off debt.

10 Steps to Buying a House,"Use this step-by-step plan to buy a house the smart way, and download our completehome-buying checklistto follow along with your progress. First things first: Before you jump into the home-buying process, I want you to be debt-free with 3–6 months of expenses saved up in anemergency fund. Think of this money like an insurance policy against life—it’s important to have this safety net when you get ready to make a big purchase like a house. Picture this: When you buy a home,you’rethe landlord! That means paying for repairs is your responsibility. So, if the water heater springs a leak two weeks after moving in, it’ll be no big deal because you have an emergency fund to cover the repairs. But when your budget is eaten up by debt payments and you don’t have any savings to fall back on, you might be eating ramen for the rest of the month just to get that water heater fixed. That’s not fun . . .ortasty. With a full emergency fund and no debt draining your monthly budget, an unexpected repair will just be an inconvenience—not the end of the world. Another thing to think about beforebuying a houseis your stage of life. It doesn’t make sense to buy a house if you plan to move sometime in the next few years. Buying and selling a house is an expensive process, and moving too quickly usually means you’ll lose money when you resell the home. This is also one of the reasons I recommend waiting at least a year after getting married before you buy a house. Here are seven things to check off your list before you’reready to buy a house: Still not sure where you fall?Take our assessment to see if you’re ready to buy. If you’re ready to buy, your next step is figuring out your home-buying budget. You should only buy a house when the monthly payment is no more than 25% of your monthly take-home pay. Anything more than that and you risk being house poor. Sticking to this number leaves plenty of room in your budget to cover home maintenance and repairs while hitting your other money goals, like saving for retirement. To be clear, that 25% limit includes principal, interest, property taxes, home insurance, homeowners association (HOA) fees and private mortgage insurance (PMI). Use ourmortgage calculatorto try out different home prices within your budget. Once you knowhow much you can afford to spendon your new home, stick to that amount. And if you’re buying a home with your spouse, make sure you’rebothon the same page about your budget. You don’t want any surprises when it comes to saving for a down payment. Just like any goal, buying a home the smart way takes planning and preparation. So, even though saving for adown paymentwill take some time and discipline, it’s a crucial part of this whole process. Howmuchshould you save? Aim for putting 20% down so you can avoidPMI, a fee added to your monthly mortgage payment to protect your lender in case you default on your loan. If you’re a first-time home buyer, a 5–10% down payment is fine, but it means you’ll be paying PMI a little bit longer. You should also save up enough cash to cover two other important costs:"
How Do You Get Preapproved?,"Amortgage lendercanprequalifyyou to buy a house with a simple conversation about your income, assets and down payment. But getting prequalified isn’t the same as getting preapproved. Preapprovaltakes a little more work. A lender will need to take a look at your paycheck stubs, tax returns and bank statements to figure out how big of a mortgage you can afford. But it pays off when you start your home search because a preapproval letter shows you’re a serious buyer. Sellers like serious buyers!"
Which Mortgage Option Is Right for You?,"Picking the wrongtype of mortgagecould turn your biggest asset—your home—into a liability. That’s why getting the right mortgage is so important. Setting your boundaries on the front end makes it easier to find a home you love that’salsoin your budget. So, what type of mortgage should you pick? Here are the two most important guidelines: Your home search mightstartwith some online window shopping, but it shouldn’tendthere. You can do a lot of research on your own, but you’ll need thehelp of an expertwhen it comes to finding and securing your perfect home. A buyer’s agent can help you navigate the home-buying process. In some cases, they can even help you find a great house before it hits the market, giving you a competitive edge. How’s that for being a smart shopper? And when it comes to making an offer, your agent will negotiate on your behalf so you don’t pay a penny more than you have to."
How Much Does a Buyer’s Agent Cost?,"It's common for a buyer’s agent to be paid a commission (for example, 3% of a home's purchase price) for helping you close on a home. In some cases, the seller might offer to cover part or even all of what it costs you to work with a buyer's agent to sweeten the deal, and to thank your agent for helping find someone to purchase their home. But every situation is different. Be sure to discuss what an agent charges for their services so you know what your maximum potential costs could be before you commit to working with one."
How to Choose the Best Buyer’s Agent,"You may know a lot of real estate agents in your area, but keep in mind that not all agents bring the same knowledge and experience to the table. Don’t work with a friend or family member who’s an amateur just because you want to be nice. A home is the biggest purchase you’ll ever make, and you need a pro on your side. That means you’ll want tointerview a few agentsbefore you hire one. Yep, make them show you why they deserve your business. When you’reinterviewing a real estate agent, don’t settle. A true rock star will have: Not surewhereto start looking for an agent? We’ve done the work for you with our RamseyTrusted®program. These real estate pros will help you reach your goals and focus on getting you the biggest bang for your buck in the home-buying process. Find a RamseyTrusted pro in your area today. After you’ve been preapproved for a mortgage, you’re ready for the fun part: shopping for your perfect home! (This was my favorite part of the process.) To get started, make a list of must-have home features. When you’rebuying a home with your spouse, make separate lists and compare. For example, I valued a bright kitchen with lots of counter space, and my husband wanted a big backyard. A nonnegotiable for both of us was a good school district. Knowing what you and your spouse want will help with the selection process. Once you have a clear picture of the features you both want, share them with your real estate agent and use them as the foundation of your home search. Your agent will help you set realistic expectations and target your search to areas and homes you can afford."
Think Long Term,"You might think you’re shopping for your forever home—but remember to shop with resale value in mind because no one knows what the future will bring. A job opportunity in another state or a growing family could change your idea of a forever home. Here are somehouse-hunting tipsto help you make a smart investment: And one more thing: When you start house hunting, you need to be prepared for it to take a while—it could take months before you find a house that’s right for you andyour budget. Now, there’s a chance (since you’re so prepared from doing your homework on the front end) that a great agent could find you a house the next day. But you shouldn’tcounton that happening. Just make sure you’re ready to go either way. Hang in there, and don’t compromise on your must-haves. Once you’ve found the right home, it’s time to get serious. That means submitting your offer and signing a purchase agreement with the sellers."
What’s Included in Your Offer?,"Your real estate agent will work with you to submit a solid offer. If you end up in a bidding war with other buyers, keep a cool head and put your best foot forward. Being preapproved with your lender and having a flexible closing date can make your offer stand out. Your purchase agreement will include other details of the real estate transaction, like: Sometimes agreeing on terms is quick and painless, but it can also be one of the hardest parts of the home-buying process. If your negotiations get intense, remind yourself that both parties want the same thing. The sellers want to sell their house, and you want to buy it! And remember: Sometimes it pays to compromise on little details if that’ll move the process forward. A good real estate agent will give you advice about when to give in and when to hold firm."
Home Inspection,"As a buyer, you have the right to aprofessional home inspectionbefore purchasing the house, and it would be crazy not to take advantage of that. This is one of the most important precautions you can take before purchasing a home because it keeps you from being blindsided by structural issues or expensive repairs. If the inspection reveals major problems with the home, you can ask the seller to fix the problem, reduce the price, or cancel the contract. You can also consider getting other pros involved so they can run even more tests, like a termite inspection or a radon test, depending on your real estate agent’s advice and the age and condition of the home you’re purchasing. Your new home could look perfect from the outside, but you never know what’s going on under the foundation or in the walls."
Appraisal,"If you’re getting a home loan, your lender will require anappraisalto assess the value of the property. An appraisal protects you from paying more than the home’s true value. If the appraisal comes in lower than your offer price, your real estate agent can provide the best guidance for what to do next. If you did get a mortgage, you’ll have another step before you can close on your home: getting final loan approval. Prepare to be patient for this part. Your lender will be digging through a ton of your financial details to finalize your mortgage, which couldtake more than a monthto hammer out before your closing date. Whatever you do, don’t open a credit card, go out and buy a bunch of new furniture on credit, or change jobs once you’re under contract. Doing stuff like this affects your debt-to-income ratio and could jeopardize the loan process. You did it! All the planning, saving, house hunting and waiting are over. The final step in the home-buying process is closing on your new place. Before you get the keys for your new home and officially call it your own, you have one more sprint ahead of you: paperwork. Bring on the hand cramps . . . You should receive a copy of your closing documents to review ahead of time so there are no surprises on closing day. Most likely, you’ll pay for: If you’re confused by any of the terms or conditions as you work through the paperwork, don’t be shy about asking questions. This is one of the biggest purchases you’ll ever make, and you should know exactly what you’re signing up for. Once you sign all the paperwork, it’s time to breathe a sigh of relief. Ahh. You’re officially a homeowner. Congratulations! The home-buying process may not be easy, but having a beautiful new home to call your own is worth it in the end."
You’ve Got This!,"Buying a house has definitely gotten more difficult over the last several years thanks to higher prices and interest rates, but it’snotimpossible. If you set a savings goal,get on a budget, and stick to it, youwillbe able to afford a home before long. It may take longer than you’d like, but youcando this! "

What Is the Best Month to Buy a House?,"If possible, it’s good to buy a house at the time of year when prices are lowest and inventory is highest. Traditionally, that’s August or September. Prices usually go down in late summer and early fall, since fewer buyers are looking at homes and inventory is still pretty high after the busy spring selling season. On the flip side, theworsttime to buy a house is typically the late spring and early summer (May through July). That’s because tons of people are in the market to buy a home—which means you’ll face more competition. Many home buyers, especially those with kiddos, want to buy a home in time to get moved and settled before the school year starts. But keep in mind: No one can predictreal estate trendswith 100% accuracy. So never let what month it is make or break your home-buying decision—only your financial situation can truly determine the right time for you. With that said, in 2024 the best time to buy a house was probably around September—when existing home prices had fallen nearly $15,000 since July and inventory was the highest it had been all year. To see these trends for yourself, check out the chart below:"
What Is the Cheapest Month to Buy a House?,"Home prices are usually at their lowest in winter. In fact, based on the 12-month period in the table above, home prices were at their lowest in January 2024—at a median of $378,600. So if the best time to buy for you means getting the lowest price, be sure to slip on your warm woolen mittens before you go to showings. But remember: You want to find the sweet spot of low pricesandhigh inventory. While prices go down during the winter, fewer houses hit the market during the busy holiday season (not to mention some regions have the cold and snow to deal with). In the chart above, the number of homes for sale saw its greatest drop from November to December—losing 140,000 homes from the market. Still, less demand for homes could give you some bargaining power when it comes time to make an offer on a house."
What Month Do Most Houses Go on the Market?,"Most houses go on the market in the spring. In 2024, the national number of homes for sale shot up an additional 90,000 from March to April—the fastest rate of growth all year. That number kept growing into the summer and reached 1.34 million home listings by July. On the downside, spring and summer are also the busiest house-hunting seasons, so competition and prices will likely be at their highest. This year, home prices shot up $9,700 from May to June and reached their highest point of the year at $426,900. But if you can budget for it, it’s often worth shopping when there’s an abundance of homes on the market to choose from."
The Best Time to Buy Depends on You,"Remember: Even though you can try timing your home purchase just right to find the widest selection or pay the lowest price, the best time to buy is when your finances are in order. Here are the biggestsigns you’re ready to buy a house: If each of those statements sounds like you—congrats! Now could be the best time for you to buy a house. "

What Is the 50/30/20 Rule?,"The 50/30/20 rule is a budgeting method where you divide your monthly after-tax income into three categories: needs (50%), wants (30%) and savings (20%)."
50%: Needs,"According to the 50/30/20 rule, you put half of yourafter-taxincome toward your needs. Now, needs are all the bills and othermonthly expensesyouhaveto pay—the things that would majorly affect your life if you dropped them. Here are some examples of needs:"
30%: Wants,"The 50/30/20 rule says to spend 30% of your take-home pay on your wants—or the stuff that improves your standard of living. But hear me when I say this: Wants arenotneeds. Yes, we all know this . . . in theory. But when you start dividing all your expenses into categories, the lines betweenneeds vs. wantscan get real blurred. Some examples of wants include: These are all expenses you can technically do without (even if it’s uncomfortable). Because you don’t have to go out to eat when you’ve got groceries in the fridge. And unless your kid outgrew their jacket and school shoes, you don’t need to buy new clothes every month."
20%: Savings,"With the 50/30/20 rule, the goal is to put 20% of your monthly income toward savings. Here are some examples of what’s included in the savings category: That’s just 20% of your income to get you feeling safe and secure with money for today, tomorrow and down the line in retirement. And with this rule, you’re somehow supposed to save forallof that at once."
50/30/20 Budget Example,"What does it look like to create a budget with the 50/30/20 rule? Well, let’s say your gross monthly income is $6,360. But after taxes and benefit deductions, you take home about $5,000 each month. If you use the 50/30/20 method to budget, you’d have $2,500 for your needs (50%), $1,500 for your wants (30%), and $1,000 for your savings (20%). Makes sense on paper. But is that actually enough to cover all your necessary expenses for the month? Should you really be spending that much on your wants, instead of building your savings? And what if you’ve got a massive pile of student loans you’re trying to pay off? You can probably tell by now that I have some problems with this rule. So, let’s get into the pros and cons."
Cons,"A benefit of the 50/30/20 rule is that it gets you to budget and save—both of which are super important! But whilerecommended budget percentagescan be a good starting point, the 50/30/20 rule ultimately falls short. Here are a few reasons why."
It’s not realistic for most budgeters.,"The truth is:The 50/30/20 rule doesn’t work for the average American.In fact, most people’s needs aremorethan 50% of their income. Seriously, look at this math: That’sover 80%of the average income that goes just to monthly needs. Now, you could find ways to lower those expenses (and you should). But my point is that it usually takesmorethan 50% of the average income for most American households to operate. And that’s not even includingdebt payments! If you’ve got a car loan, credit cards or student loans to pay off, then you probably don’t have 30% left for fun and 20% for savings. When you put the 50/30/20 rule to the test, well . . . that math doesn’t add up! Literally. "
It doesn’t prioritize saving over wants.,"With the 50/30/20 rule, you budget 30% for your wants and put 20% toward savings. Yes, saving 20% is better than saving nothing at all. But that’s not the best (or fastest) way to build your savings. Savings should be a priority—not an afterthought. Especially if you’re saving up for your emergency fund or for a big goal, like a down payment on a house. The 50/30/20 rule makes it easy to put savings on the back burner, when it should be one of thevery firstthings you budget for each month."
It doesn’t help you pay off debt faster.,"With the 50/30/20 rule, you’re paying off your debt . . . butslowly. It combines both saving and extra debt payments to make up only 20% of your overall budget. That’s not enough if you really want to make a dent in your debt! And if you’ve got debt, you shouldn’t be spending 30% of your money on things you don’t need anyway. You should be focusing on knocking out your debtas fast as you can. That meanscutting back on extra costs(aka thewants) so you can throw more at your debt and take back control of your income. Plus, trying to hit too many major money goals at once can actually keep you from making progress. You’re much better off if you line up your big money goals in order of priority (using the7 Baby Stepsto guide you) and knock them down one by one. You’ll be able to really focus as you save for emergencies, pay off debt, and build your retirement savings—in that order. And when your budget is set up to help you take those steps one at a time, you know what happens? You. Make. Progress. Faster. And that’s what I want for you—to make progress with your money! Your budget should live and breathe with you. It should adapt toyourstage of life and toyourmoney goals. The 50/30/20 rule just doesn’t do that."
The 50/30/20 Rule vs. the Zero-Based Budget,"The 50/30/20 rule boxes you in. But budgets aren’t one-size-fits-all. Your budget should reflectyourreality. It should reflect where you are right nowandwhere you want to be with your money—not force your expenses into some blanket percentage category. What you really need is a zero-based budget. What’s that? Azero-based budgetis when your income minus your expenses equals zero. You give every dollar a job and make every part of your paycheck work for you and your goals! When you budget, start with giving, next saving, and then needs (what I call theFour Walls—food, utilities, shelter and transportation—and then other essentials). After that, you prioritize everything else in the budget based onyourincome,yoursituation andyourBaby Step. The zero-based budget method is better than the 50/30/20 rule because it lets you customize your budget to your specific expenses and money goals.It also helps you make progress faster and intentionally get your spending under control. Plus, a zero-based budget is way more flexible! As things change in your life, so does your budget."

1. Get on a budget.,"It all begins with a budget—a plan for your money. Budgeting can get a bad rap because people think it takes away your freedom. But budgeting is seriously so empowering. And that’s because when you budget,youare telling your money where to go so you can stop wondering where it went. If you haven’t been doing this in the past,make a budget. Pronto. It’s the first step to taking control and being intentional with your money."
2. Budget for inflation.,"When people budget, they say they feel like they got a raise. And with inflation, that “raise” is something we could all use, right? Also, budgeting is how you create margin with your money. Because when you plan out where your money’s going, you’ll easily see the spots to cut or trim back. And if you decide you need to get aside hustleto help balance the rising costs, budgeting is how you’ll make sure that extra income gets used for what you need—instead of accidentally getting spent on checkout-line candy bars or one-click impulse buys. Yes, inflation is tough. But you (and your budget) are tougher! So,adjust that budget for inflation, and you can stand up to those rising costs."
3. Pay off your debt!,"While you’re at it—pay offallyour debt! Debt keeps you stuck in the past and robs you of so many opportunities, right now and in the future. Don’t know where to start? Usethe debt snowball methodto knock those payments out of your life. One. By. One. You’ll start with the smallest and work your way to the largest: building momentum and motivation with each stamp of “paid in full.” Listen: The freedom that comes from being debt-free is like nothing else. Is it weird? Yeah. Is it worth it? Heck yeah."
4. Pay attention to your online spending habits.,"Here’s another important thing to do differently with your money: Pay attention to your online spending habits. Because the ability to buy something quickly and have it at your door pronto is like having a genie in a bottle . . . who drains your bank account with every click of that “buy now” button. How can you keep yourself in check here? Try one (or all) of these: We aren’t against online shopping. Itcansave you time and money when you do it well! But it’s so easy tonotdo it well. So, pull out the budget, review your online spending habits, and make it as difficult as possible for you tooverspend online. P.S. We all know that reviewing and changing your budget is way easier with a budgeting app.Andwe happen to have one calledEveryDollar. And it’s free."
5. Make sure your emergency fund is fully funded.,"This one depends on whatBaby Stepyou’re on. What’s that? The 7 Baby Steps are the proven, guided path to save money, pay off debt, and build wealth. And getting your emergency fund set up is part of that path! If you’ve got debt, you need just $1,000 in savings as astarteremergency fund (Baby Step 1). Then attack that debt with the debt snowball method we mentioned earlier. (That’s Baby Step 2.)Thenbuild up a fully funded emergency fund (aka Baby Step 3). How much money should you save up? Three to six months of expenses. Why is an emergency fund important? This safety net in life gives you a ton of peace and comfort knowing you’ve got cash in the bank to pay for the emergencies that are bound to happen. So, if you’re ready to finish up Baby Step 3, get at it! And if you had to dip into your emergency fund last year, rebuild it!"
6. Don’t stop investing.,"Speaking of Baby Steps, saving for retirement is what comes after you’ve built up that fully funded emergency fund. If you’re there right now,don’t stop investing just because the market is down. Retirement investing is a long game. It’s a lot like a roller coaster—and you know what happens when people jump off a roller coaster in the middle of the ride? They. Get. Hurt. Ride the ups and the downs. Keep investing."
7. Don’t sit on the sidelines if you’re ready to buy a home.,"If you’re ready to buy a home, buy a home—don’t wait on rates or prices to drop. Buthow do you know if you’re ready?"
"8. If you’re married, get a joint checking account.","When you get married, the two become one. And that includes your finances! This means living with anoursattitude, not dividing income and bills and payments. All that division with your money can create division in your marriage. But when you work as a team—you’ll winfasterfinancially. Communicate. Combine dreams. Go toward the same main goals. Together! If you’ve been dragging your feet tocombine your checking accounts—this is the time to do it."

The Stats on the Student Loan Crisis,Here’s a snapshot to help you see the bigger picture of the student loan crisis:
The History of Student Loan Debt,"Believe it or not,student loanshaven’t been around forever. They began in 1957 mostly to encourage more students (especially those in the fields of science, math and foreign languages) to attend college—all so Americans could have a chance to beat the Russians during the “space race.” And this strategy worked, with college attendance rising significantly during the 60s.7 And can you guess what else shot up? That’s right, student loan debt. You might blame student loans on the huge rise in tuition costs (which are almost 20 times higher than 50 years ago), or the surge ininflationover time, or all the pressure from society to get a college degree.8But whatever the cause, there’s one thing we can all agree on: Student loans have reached crisis levels. And it doesn’t look like they’re going to slow down anytime soon."
Student Loan Debt Totals by Age,"It’s easy to think student loan debt is only a problem for young people and recent graduates, but that’s definitely not true. In fact, some people arestillpaying off their student loans when their own kids head off to college. If you find that hard to believe, here’s a breakdown of the current total student loan debt Americans carry, broken down by age range:"
The Financial Impact of Student Loans,"The truth is, student loans are meant to make college more accessible for people, but they actually create a lifetime of financial stress. Let’s crunch some numbers to see how. First, here’s a look at the typical student loan balance, interest rate and monthly payment: So, how long would someone strapped down by the average numbers be stuck in the mud? Well, if you plug them into ourStudent Loan Payoff Calculator, you’ll see that a borrower with $37,797 of debt at a 6.53% interest rate and a $500 monthly payment will be paying down that loan fornine years. But wait, there’s more . . . You won’tjustbe paying the student loan amount. At the end of those nine years, you’ll have paid anextra$11,000 in interest alone. Yep, that $37,797 loan will actually cost you close to $49,000 when it’s all said and done."
The Hidden Cost of Student Loan Debt,"Here’s what most people don’t realize before taking out student loans: Having a pile of debt makes it much harder to afford major life purchases. And since the average borrower takes 20 years to pay off student loans, that burden can last for quite a while.13 Just look at these results from a 2022 survey of over 5,000 adults with student loans. Many of them delay major life choices to pay off their student debt:"
Why Do People Rely on Student Loans?,"Many Americans have the mindset that a college degree is the only ticket to a well-paying job, happiness and overall success in life. So it’s no wonder that high school students are nervous, worrying they won’t get a decent job if they don’t have a degree. And it’s easy to believe the only way to afford their college degree is to take out a loan. But none of this is true. Plenty of people who never went to college have “made it” with hard work. Lots of opportunities are out there tomake good money without a college degree. Now,collegecanoffer you an amazing education, and some fields like law and medicine require a degree. But it may not beyouronly ticket to success. And keep in mind that a degree is a degree, no matter where it’s from—and it’s 100% possible to get a degree without loans by picking a more affordable school. If that means you go to a community college, good for you! Ten years from now, it won’t matter, and you’ll be ahead of the game without any debt."
How to Get Yourself Out of Student Loan Debt,If you’re in the middle of this student loan crisis—carrying debt and slowly digging your way out with monthly payments—there is hope! You don’t have to stay in this cycle forever. You can get out—and you don’t have to rely on things likedebt consolidationorstudent loan refinancing. Follow these tips to get started: I know the student loan crisis seems overwhelming to even think about. That $1.6 trillion total is serious business. But the looming national debt isn’t something you have to take down yourself. Just focus on how you can knock outyourdebt—and teach your kids to steer clear of student loans completely. Don’t let the country’s student debt crisis create a personal crisis for you. Make the choice to get out of debt and take the steps to move forward with your life. You can do this!

How to Track Expenses in 4 Steps,"Tracking your expenses isn’t hard, but you do have to make it a habit. And just like other important habits (for example, flossing), it takes repetition to go from trying to remember to do it to doing it regularly. Here are four steps to help you get into the habit of expense tracking:"
1. Create a Budget,"Before you can track your expenses, you need to create abudget. A budget is simply a plan for your money that you make every month. And listen, there are a lot of budgeting methods out there. But the best is azero-based budget, where you give every dollar that comes in during the month a job to do—whether that’s giving, saving or spending. If budgeting is new to you, you might be a bit confused. So, let’s talk real quick about how toset up your budget."
2. Track Any Money You Earn,"When your regular paychecks come into your bank account, enter that amount in the income part of your budget. If you make money through aside hustleor you sell some stuff you no longer need, log that income too. This step is super important if you have an irregular income. Remember, you planned low when you listed your income. So if your income turns out to be more than you planned, this is when you’ll adjust the number. You can add that money to your currentmoney goalsor cover some extras in the budget. Even if you’ve got a steady paycheck, you still need to track your income! For one thing, you can make sure nothing’s off with your paycheck. For another, you’re creating that habit of tracking."
3. Track Any Money You Spend,"Track every single transaction. All month long. When you fill up thegas tank, subtract that expense from your gas budget line. When you pay the rent, subtract that expense from your housing line. When you buy tickets to see your favorite boy band’s reunion tour, subtract that expense from entertainment (or maybe you’ve got a specific budget line just for concerts). If you spend it, track it. Whether the money’s coming out of your wallet, bank account, PayPal, cash envelope, coin purse or old-fashioned piggy bank . . . you get the picture. As you track your spending, make sure you’resubtractingtoo (even better if you’ve got a budgeting app that does the mathforyou). Then you can see how much you have left in your different budget categories for the month. This is a super important part of tracking—because it’s how you keep yourself from overspending!"
4. Set a Regular Rhythm for Tracking,"Track your expenses regularly. That might be weekly, daily—or before you leave the grocery store parking lot. Do whatever works for you and helps you keep up with all your expenses for the month. (If you know thosepaper receipts are just going to get lost in the bottom of your purse, don’t set yourself up to fail.) Also, if you’re married, make sure you’re both working from the same budget and tracking expenses. This is great foraccountabilityand communication. That way, neither one of you can say, “I didn’t know you spent most of the entertainment budget on zip-lining tickets. I wanted to sign us up for a couples hip-hop dance class.” The more you track expenses, the more aware you’ll be of your spending. No more surprise transactions derailing your budget—you’rethe one in control."
Expense-Tracking Methods,"Okay, so now you know the basic steps to track your expenses. But there are several expense-tracking methods you can use to do these steps. Here are four ways to track your expenses:"
Pencil and Paper,"Don’t dismiss old-school methods. Whether it’s filling out a budget template or freestyling it on a yellow legal pad, plenty of people love a good paper budget to track expenses. Pros Cons Conclusion Hey, tracking expenses with pencil and paper is way better than not tracking expenses at all. If it’s the only way you want to go, then go for it! "
The Envelope System,"The envelope systemfocuses on paying cash for as many things in the budget as you can. You can autodraft expenses like retirement contributions, mortgage payments and some utility bills, and you might send checks or make a debit card payment online for other bills. But you’ll use physical cash for all the expenses you pay for in person. For this method, you start by labeling some envelopes with the budget lines you want to pay for in cash—like groceries, entertainment and restaurants. (You can also use aspecial divided wallet.) Then, fill each envelope with the amount of money you budgeted for that particular line. Pros Cons Conclusion Physically watching the money leave the envelope inspires a whole new level of responsibility. Even if you go with a different method to track expenses,doing the envelope system with at leastsomeof your budget lines is a great way to manage your money."
Computer Spreadsheets,"Okay, let’s talk software, specificallycomputer spreadsheets, as another way to track expenses. Pros Cons Conclusion If spreadsheets are the only way you (or your spouse) want to budget and handle expense tracking, that’s cool. But know there are more convenient tracking methods out there."
Expense-Tracker Apps (aka Budgeting Apps),"We love a goodbudgeting app. Seriously. Most of us always have our phones on us—which means we can always have our budgets on us! Brilliant. Pros Cons Conclusion A budgeting app is the best way to track expenses because it makes it way easier to create a budget, regularly track your expenses, and stay on the same page with your spouse if you’re married. Win, win andwin!"

Understanding Medicare,"Medicare is the federalgovernment’s health insurance programfor people age 65 and older, as well as those with certain disabilities. Depending on how long you’ve been working, you’ve likely already covered at least some of the costs of Medicare over your career, since it’s funded through payroll taxes. During those working years, health insurance coverage through your employee benefit was probably the most affordable route. But once you retire and the company’s no longer chipping in, coverage will get expensive. (You self-employed folks have already been paying the entire Medicare tax instead of having half of it covered by an employer—and that can make Medicare seem expensive! Financial aid is available, and we’ll talk more about that below.) Medicare can be a big help—as long as you choosethe right kind of coverage. As a government program, Medicare has worked out discounted costs with any provider that accepts Medicare patients. That means the Medicare-approved price for services will be lower than you’d see with regular, private health insurance. You canenroll in Medicarewhen you turn 65 during your Initial Enrollment Period. In fact, you’re required to enroll as soon as you’re eligible, or you’ll have to pay a penalty. But if you miss your IEP, you can sign up any year after that during a General Enrollment Period from January 1 to March 31 (or during a Special Enrollment Period, if you qualify). There’s also something known as the Medicare Open Enrollment Period, but—this part’s a little confusing—it’sonlyfor making changes to an existing plan, not for signing up for the first time. Those are your Medicare basics. Now, how much does all this stuff cost? "
How Much Does Medicare Cost?,"Your annual cost for Medicare depends on three main factors: We’ve summarized what your premiums, deductibles and coinsurance will look like for each part of Medicare in the table below. Later, we’ll break down these basic costs. Source:Medicare.govunless otherwise noted. Let’s imagine a typical year of costs. Say you have Original Medicare (aka Parts A and B). You’ll pay nothing in premiums for Part A and a total of $2,096 in premiums for Part B (your monthly premium times 12). Assuming that you never need any hospital or medical care during the year, you’ll spend a little over $2,000 for Medicare. But now let’s say you need one hospital stay during the year. Your deductible for that stay will be $1,632 if it lasts less than 60 days. You’ll also be paying a $240 annual deductible for any use you make of Part B services (medical insurance). Your services for Parts A and B might or might not meet those deductible limits, but if they do, you’re looking at a total of $1,872 in annual deductibles for that benefit period. All told, your annual total (with premiums) would land at $3,968. That total can vary even more if you But the numbers above give you a rough outline of typical annual costs. Here’s something to keep in mind with Part A: Youcanhave more than one benefit period in a year (which we’ll describe more below), which means you’d be subject to another deductible for each new benefit period in which you need hospital services. Also, should a hospital stay exceed 60 days, you’d be responsible for additional daily coinsurance to cover that. And the additional coinsurance for skilled nursing care kicks in after just 20 days. On the other hand, if you have a Medigap plan, it will usually cover all deductibles, copays or coinsurance for any services you receive under Parts A and B. Of course, the premiums on Medigap will vary by plan, so you’ll need to compare those annual premiums to the numbers in the Original Medicare examples we walked through above to find out which kind of Medicare is better for you. "
Basic Costs Associated With Medicare,Next let’s break down the main costs for each part of Medicare.
Medicare Part A,"Part A is your hospital coverage. Premiums:Most people don’t pay a premium if they or their spouse paid Medicare taxes for at least 10 years. But if that’s not you, your premium will range from about $274 to $507 per month in 2024. For the few folks who do pay a Part A premium, it’s rising a bit in 2025 to a maximum of $518 a month.3 Deductibles:The Part A deductible is $1,632 (and rising to $1,676 in 20254) per benefit period. What’s that? Let’s see. Benefit Periods:Medicare uses benefit periods to calculate coverage. Each benefit period begins on the date you’re admitted for skilled nursing facility care or an inpatient hospital stay. It ends when you haven’t received inpatient hospital or skilled nursing care for 60 days in a row—which means, in theory, a single benefit period could last for many months. But once you pass that window of time between services, a new event would start a new benefit period—and you’d need to meet your deductible again. Thankfully, it’s mathematically impossible to trigger more than six benefit periods in a single calendar year, so at most, your maximum Part A deductible cost would be around 10 grand. That explains why most people need some kind of supplemental coverage beyond Original Medicare. "
Medicare Part B,"This is your medical insurance. It covers things like doctor visits and outpatient services. Premiums:The standard monthly premium is $174.70 in 2024 (rising to $185 in 2025), but it can be higher for individuals with higher incomes due to something the government calls income-adjusted premiums. Depending on your income, increases could range from $70 to $441 per month. Deductibles:The Part B deductible is $240 per year in 2024, rising to $257 in 2025. You have to admit, that’s a lot more affordable than the Part A deductible. Coinsurance:Once you’ve met your deductible, you’ll usually be responsible for 20% of the Medicare-approved cost for services. "
Medicare Part C,"Sometimes known as Medicare Advantage, Part C bundles together Parts A and B, and in most cases Part D too (more on Part D below). Private insurance companies offer these packages to supplement Original Medicare. One of the main reasons people might choose Medicare Advantage is because it carries a defined annual limit on how much you’ll pay out of pocket. Here’s another thing to keep in mind about the cost of Part C—you canonlyuse providers within a defined network. If you need (or choose) to go outside that network (say, for a certain specialist), all costs are coming out of your pocket. Premiums:Perhaps surprisingly, there are sometimestwopremiums to pay here. Most participants pay an average of $18.50 per month for the overall package, and many people also have to pay the premium for Part B (a standard rate of $174.50 a month). But many Medicare Advantage plans have no Part C premium. And some plans will help pay all—or at least a portion—of the Part B premium as well. So a Medicare Advantage plan could cost between $0 and $200 a month in premiums. Deductibles:These vary a lot, depending on which insurance company you buy Part C from. You’ll want to read up on the plans as you shop. And along the way, consider using a well-informedMedicare advisor! Out-of-Pocket Maximum:Plans are allowed to set their own out-of-pocket maximums, but the legal maximum is $8,850 (going up to $9,350 in 2025).5Within a Medicare Advantage plan, that limit only applies to Parts A and B (which usually make up most of your costs anyway). It doesn’t apply to any costs you might be charged for under Part D during a coverage year.6And what might Part D cover? Let’s find out! "
Medicare Part D,"Part D (if you buy it) is your prescription drug coverage, once again coming to you from a private insurance company. And there’s some big and exciting news about how much those scripts will cost you. Due to a new law that goes into effect in 2025, the new annual out-of-pocket maximum for Part D drugs will be $2,000.7 Average Total Premium:It can vary a lot by plan and income level, but the monthly average is about $55. Similar to the premiums for Part B, premiums for Part D go up if you earn above certain income levels. This increase ranges from $12.90 to $81 per month. Deductibles:These depend on which plan you buy, and not all plans require a deductible. The maximum deductible amount is $545 per year.8 Copays:You can probably guess—this also varies by plan. But it’s pretty easy to find out your plan’s prescription costs. The Coverage Gap:This is also sometimes called the Part D “donut hole.” It refers to something that will soon become obsolete because of the legislation we mentioned earlier that limits the annual out-of-pocket maximum. But basically, once your drug costs go above a certain coverage limit for the year, you’ll have to start paying more for your prescriptions. Then, after you’ve reached another out-of-pocket limit, the plan will pick up your costs again. Thankfully, the new law is set to close the donut hole from now on—or at least until the law changes again! As a recap, each part of Medicare comes with its own yearly deductible. In 2024, the Part A deductible is $1,632, the one for Part B is $240, and Part D’s is no more than $545 per year.9,10Since Part C comes from private insurance companies, its deductible varies. That’s a lot of deducting! And even once youhityour deductible, you still have to pay coinsurance—which is the percentage of the cost you’re responsible for (usually 20%). All that adds up quick. Plus, there’s no out-of-pocket maximum for Original Medicare, if that’s all you have! It would be nice if there were a way to supplement your coverage and save, right? Well, there is! "
Medigap (Supplemental Insurance),"We’ve already talked about the government’s solution for managing the cost of Original Medicare, which they call Medicare Advantage, or Part C. Another option, available through private insurance companies, is calledMedigap (aka a Medicare supplement plan). Medigap plans are designed to help pay costs Medicare doesn’t cover—like coinsurance and deductibles. Monthly Premiums:Again, these are going to vary quite a bit. Some of the factors that come into play for pricing your specific Medigap premium include: "
Types of Medigap Plans and Coverage Portions,"Source: Medicare.gov11 The table gives you a pretty good sense of what’s covered in each Medigap plan and how much each plan covers of the benefit types. But not all plans are available to everyone, and some offer different benefits to different customers, depending on when they enroll. To zero in on the cost of a few plans, look at the following. Plan G:It’s the most popular Medigap plan that’s still available to anyone, likely because it has a pretty affordable average monthly premium of $164 and 100% coverage for most benefits. Plan K:This plan covers half the cost of most benefits, and the monthly premium range is $82-162. Plan L:Charging slightly higher premiums of $182-212, Plan L also ups the share of coverage for most benefits to 75%. At the risk of being repetitive: It’s smart to work with an experienced Medicare advisor who can walk you through the details of every available plan and point you to one that best fits your needs! "
Financial Assistance Programs,"Face it: Like any other form of health insurance, Medicare is expensive, regardless of your plan or parts. Thankfully, financial assistance programs can help."
Medicaid,"Medicaid is not insurance—instead it’s a joint federal and state health care assistance program for lower-income Americans.Medicaidhelps cover things like personal care, nursing home care and premium assistance. And it can be a big help in shouldering the cost of Medicare. Services and benefits vary by state, but in general your eligibility for Medicaid is determined by your income level and your assets. Medicaid costs are usually minimal or free. Those who qualify usually don’t have to pay any sort of premium because it’s not insurance. On the other hand, most states do require some form of out-of-pocket cost-sharing for certain services. For other services (like a trip to the emergency room), there’s never any copay. "
Extra Help for Prescription Drug Costs,You can get more help covering your Medicare prescription drug costs if you qualify under certain income and resource limits. Medicare has a program called Extra Help with Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Costs. You canapply online.
Medicare Savings Programs,"Medicare Savings Programs (MSPs) cover some or all of your premiums for Medicare Parts A and B, plus deductibles, copays and coinsurance for people who earn below certain income limits. These programsare designed to make sure every American has health insurance coverage. You don’t have to qualify for Medicaid to get help through an MSP. "
Planning for Medicare Costs,"If you’re eligible for Part A, it just makes sense to take the free coverage. You’ll have to make the call on whether the other parts are worth it for you based on your specific financial situation. Keep this in mind: As complex as Medicare is (not to mention the laws around it), you’d be smart to work with a knowledgeable advisor as you shop and enroll. "
Find Help as You Shop for Medicare,"As you can see, there are a whole lot of costs no matter which plans or parts of Medicare you wind up choosing to enroll in. And although we’ve laid it all out as simply as we can, it wouldn’t be surprising if you still had plenty of questions about eligibility, services and (especially) cost! There are folks who felt just like you, who went and did the research themselves, and who are here to help you navigate the ins and outs of Medicare with confidence. The good people atChapterare licensed advisors. They’ll walk you through your options and help you pick the right Medicare plan for your needs—not the one that will line an agent’s pockets the best. But they don’t stop there. After you’ve enrolled, they’ll help you use your benefits and get the most out of Medicare. "

How to Save Money on Housing in College,"You have to live somewhere, right? No argument there. But when you’re a college student, housing can mean anything from a small apartment that you share with roommates to a luxury dorm with a hot tub and a view of the city skyline. Let’s look at some ways to keep things budget-friendly."
Live at home if you can.,"You’re probably ready to get out of the house and bask in your new freedom, and living at home might be thelastthing you want to do. And obviously, this won’t be an option for everyone. But just think about not having to pay thousands of dollars per year on rent, utility bills or food. (Homemade foodis way better anyway, right?) All that extra money in your bank account will be totally worth it."
Compare the costs of living on versus off campus.,"Renting an apartment isn’t always going to be cheaper than living on campus, and living on campus isn’t always going to be cheaper than renting. You just have to look at all the options available at your school of choice and in the surrounding area to see what’s most affordable. Pro tip: Don’t forget to factor in utilities and transportation costs."
Find a roommate.,"If you do rent an apartment, having aroommate(or two or three) will cut your expenses way down. Make sure your landlord has approved each individual roommate and that they all sign the lease so you won’t be left hanging financially if one of them has to move out."
Ask yourself how much space youreallyneed.,"You might want a huge kitchen or your own bathroom, but let’s be honest: Do you reallyneedall that extra room while you’re trying to save money? You might be able to get by in a smaller space for right now, and then once you have a fully fundedemergency fundand are financially stable, upgrade to something bigger!"
Get creative with your bills.,"Unplug your electronics when you’re not using them to save energy, use cold water when you can, turn off the air conditioning or heat when the weather’s good, check for dripping faucets or lights left on before you leave the house, and hand-wash some dishes (it won’t kill you)."
How to Save Money on Food,Food––another one of those things you can’t live without. But youcanlive without daily avocado toast. Here are some ways to spend less on food.
Split food costs with roommates.,You and your roommate(s) can save a ton if you go in ongroceries––especially if you buy in bulk. You may even find that grocery shopping or cooking together is a fun way to hang out.
Be strategic about eating out.,"It’s okay to go out with your friends every once in a while, but when you’re constantly getting waffles at 2 a.m. on impulse, it really starts to add up. (And your body starts to hate you.) Budget the amount of money you can spend on eating out every month, and once you spend that money, you’ll have to say no until next month."
Be smart about your meal plan.,"Meal plan costs can vary depending on your school––cheaper ones can be about $1,000 per semester, but some can be three times that (or more)! Some colleges might make you get a meal plan for your freshman year, so if you have to get one, make sure you actually use it. But if youdon’thave to get one,meal preppingand making food from scratch are your new best friends."
Use coupons.,"You probably don’t want to use a coupon on afirst date, but there’s no shame in using them tosave on groceries. Even if they only save you a dollar here and there, it’s still worth it—those savings can add up quickly."
How to Save Money on Tuition and Supplies,"This is definitely the most expensive category, but that just means there’s even more room for savings!"
Buy used books.,"It’s crazy how much you can save just by getting your textbooks from eBay or a used bookstore instead of the campus bookstore. You probably won’t findallyour required reading at those cheaper places, but even if you do have to use the campus bookstore, they’ll usually give you the option to rent instead of buy. Definitely go with renting—you won’t need to go back and read your physics textbook once the semester is over."
Take classes at community college first.,"You can save a lot on tuition by getting all of your general education requirements out of the way at a community college before heading to your school of choice, because the price difference is insane. Seriously––a year of tuition at a private school is, on average, more thannine timesthe cost of a year of tuition at a community college!1Just make sure your credits will transfer to the college of your choice."
Go to an in-state school.,"The average tuition at a public, in-state school is $9,750 per year, and the average tuition at a public, out-of-state school is $28,386 per year.2That’s a yearly difference of more than $18,000! If it’s an out-of-stateprivatecollege, the tuition skyrockets even more."
Apply for scholarships.,"It’s kind of a no-brainer: If youfind scholarships, you won’t have to worry about tuition costs. Some scholarships even cover your books, food and housing."
Take advantage of tax credits.,"Two popular tax credits can help you or your parents (if they claim you as a dependent) save some dough when tax season rolls around: theAmerican opportunity tax credit (AOTC)and thelifetime learning credit (LLC). You can only claim one of these credits per student per tax year, and you have to meet the eligibility requirements to qualify for them. But if you do, claiming the AOTC or the LLC can help you recoup some of the money you spend on higher education expenses, like tuition and textbooks."
How to Save Money on Transportation,"Not everyone remembers to factor this into theircollege budget, especially if they know they’re going to be living on campus and walking a lot. But the truth is, you’ll need to get to places off campus at some point, so it’s smart to think about this stuff ahead of time."
Ride a bike.,"Nobody likes spending money on gas. With bikes, you don’t have to."
Carpool.,"Did we mention that nobody likes spending money on gas? We’re not saying you shouldonlymake friends in college so you can split the cost of fuel, but it’s absolutely one of the perks of friendship."
Use public transportation.,"This could be anything from the bus system to subways to rideshare services. According to the American Public Transportation Association, riders can save more than $13,000 a year by using public transportation instead of driving.3Depending on how often you use public transportation, you might want to buy passes instead of individual tickets––it costs more up front, but it will help you save in the long run."
How to Save Money on Entertainment,"You’ll definitely need to kick back between classes and tests, so here’s how to do it without breaking the bank."
Cancel the cable.,"Let’s be real—cable TV is pretty much a waste of time and money. There are plenty ofcheaper optionsthat let you pick what you want to watch on demand so you’re not flipping through the channels for hours and paying for junk you don’t watch. Hulu, Netflix, Google TV, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV and Sling TV are all good, but a word to the wise: You really just needonestreaming serviceat a time."
"If you have a gym membership, cancel it.","Staying fit is great, but if you really need to save, cutting your gym membership could save you a ton of money. Plus, your school will probably have a student gym that’s included in the price of tuition and fees. And there are plenty of ways to get exercise without going to the gym—like running, intramural sports or throwing a frisbee around."
Go to the library.,"Yeah, remember those? If you’re bored because you canceled your cable and gym membership and you can’t buy anything, there’s always the option of reading all the books and watching all the movies in the library for free."
Build strong friendships.,"Building good relationships in college has way more to do with the amount of time you invest than the amount of money you spend. Even if it’s just getting a group together for a game night, going thrift shopping, or sitting around and talking, the time you spend with yourfriendsis something you’ll remember way past graduation—a whole lot more than napping and playing video games."
Sell your stuff.,"If you need cash, eBay is your new best friend. Or Facebook Marketplace, or posting pics of your stuff on Instagram—whatever gets the things you don’t need out of your house and the money into your pocket."
Have a part-time job or side hustle.,"Don’t underestimate the effect that a few babysitting or dog-walking jobs per week can have on your savings. For a steadier income, a part-time job (no more than 15–20 hours per week) is a great idea too. Just don’t worksomuch that your grades suffer."
Find all the student discounts and coupons you can.,"We’re talking all the restaurants, museums and movie theaters in your area that give discounts to college students. Wherever you go, don’t be afraid to flash that student ID and ask if there are any deals available."
The Bottom Line,"At the end of the day, you just want to be intentional with your money as a student. If you stay disciplined and keep these money-saving tips in mind, you’ll be in good shape. You’ve got this!"

How to Save Money on Groceries,"Here are 25 ways to help you fill your carts, fridges, pantries and stomachs—while still respecting your budget."
1. Redefinedinner.,"If the worddinnermakes you picture a big homemade meal with a pot roast fresh out of the oven, two carefully prepped sides of fresh veggies from the farmers market, a warm loaf of French bread, and a chocolate cake freshly baked from scratch—it’s time to give yourself a break. This isn’t 1952, and supper doesn’t have to be a huge, complicated feast. Serve. Simple. Meals. Have pancakes, scrambled eggs and fruit for dinner—your kids will love that. Enjoy a soup and grilled cheese night. Pick some simpler, cheaper meals to shrink your stressandyour grocery budget."
2. Crunch some numbers while you shop.,"Pull up the calculator on your phone and keep track of everything you put in the cart. If you keep a running total of groceries as you go, you’ll save yourself from any bad surprises when you get up to the checkout counter. Just don’t forget sales tax, or your numbers will be way off in the end."
3. Raid your pantry.,"Challenge yourself to look through your pantry and fridge to see what kinds of meals you can throw together with the ingredients youalreadyhave. Who says you have to stock up on more groceries when there are perfectly good chicken thighs shoved in the back of your freezer and a couple of unopened cans of black beans and salsa on your shelves? You might still need to buy a few items to make full meals, but you’ll savea lotby using food you already have. Pro tip: Here are somerecipes for cheap and easy pantry mealsfor inspiration!"
4. Think before you buy in bulk.,"Buying in bulkis amazing . . . when it actually saves you money. But don’t assume the big bulk buys at the discount stores are automatically the cheaper option. When you’re grocery shopping on a budget, you need to compare the price per unit or ounce. The bigger bottle of shampoo isn’t always the best deal! Also, as tempting as it is to stock up, don’t buy more than you really need—especially when it comes to things that go bad. Throwing half of your giant bag of oranges away because they rotted in your fruit basket doesn’t save you a dime."
5. Know when to shop.,"When it comes to getting a good deal, timing is key. Find out if your go-to grocery store has a day of the week when they offer special deals. Also, make sure you know the sales cycles. Some grocery stores put out their new weekly deals on Sunday, but others do it on a random day of the week."
6. Start freezing and storing meals now.,"Freezer meals are great because you can prep ahead of time and end up having great meals in the week with less stress. Look online for great recipes, do prep work for most of the week in a couple hours, and then you’re just pulling things out of the freezer every night andneverworrying ingredients will go bad before you get to them! You’ll save time. You’ll save money. You’ll lower your stress. And you can confidently say no to those drive-thru temptations because youknowan easy dinner is waiting at home! This tip is a lifesaver for busy budgeters."
7. Make a meal plan.,"This is one of my absolute favorite tips for how to save money on groceries. Are you ready for this? Make ameal planand a grocery list before you ever leave the house. Look to see what you already have in the fridge, pantry and freezer while you plan. Use sales ads and any coupons you have when you make your plan—so you know you’re getting the best deals all around. Pro tip: Get my freeMeal Planner & Grocery Savings Guideto learn even more!"
8. Stick to the grocery list.,"Okay,makingthe grocery list from your meal plan is just the first part here. When you get to the store,stick to the list. I mean it! That’s how you’ll say goodbye toimpulse buysthat rack up your bill and how you’ll avoid purchases that seem like a good idea but end up in the trash. You’ll save so much when you stick to that grocery list."
9. Order curbside pickup.,"If you get a little sidetracked when you’re shopping in person,order your groceriesfor curbside pickup. Let’s face it, the food images on your screen are way less tempting than that freshly baked coffee cake that catches your eye when you’re innocently reaching for the loaf of bread that’s actually on your list. Shopping online is also an easy way to compare brand prices, see what’s on sale, and watch the total add up in real time without the calculator! Plus, you’ll save time by avoiding all that walking around the store. Lots of stores offer this service at no charge. But even if there’s a small fee, you might save overall with this method—so do some math and see for yourself."
10. Shop in season.,"When you’regrocery shopping on a budget, it’s super important to shop produce that’s in season. Buying fresh mangoes in January will cost you way more than average—and they might not even taste good! So make those mango salsa recipes in the summer and only buy fruits and veggies when they’re in season."
11. Ignore eye-level items.,"Have you ever noticed that the most expensive items on the grocery shelves are right at your eye level? That’s no accident. Grocery stores are smart. They want you toseethose items and splurge. Instead of falling for those marketing tricks, look up and down as you shop. The more affordable brands tend to be higher or lower on the shelves. Now that you know what those clever stores are up to, you can literally keep your eye out for grocery savings."
12. Try different grocery stores.,"You guys, it may be time to break up with your go-to grocery store. It’s not you—it’s their overpriced produce. Find thecheapest grocery storein your area. I’m talking about Aldi, Market Basket, WinCo Foods, Food 4 Less, Costco,Walmartand Trader Joe’s. But don’t get too comfy at just one of those. Check the weekly ads to see what’s on sale at competing grocery stores. Go where the sales are! That’s how you really save on groceries."
13. Save certain purchases for when they’re on sale.,"I’ve got a few brand-name items I simply will not skimp on. But here’s the way I make it work with my budget: I only buy those pricier items when they’re on sale or I have a coupon or—better yet—both! If you watch sale trends and stock up on your favorite thingsonlywhen you’ve got a deal, you’ll save so much on groceries."
14. Limit your shopping trips.,"The more times you pop into the store, the more opportunities you have to overspend. By the way, remember how I said to meal plan and stick to your grocery list? Well, following those tips is how you’ll get this one to work."
15. Don’t shop when you’re hungry.,"Listen, when I’m hungry, I can’t say I’m my best self. And when I’m hungry in a store with nearly endless food options? Everything looks good and my grocery list just won’t cut it. Walk into the grocery store with a full stomach, and you’ll probably be shocked by how much lower your grocery bill is."
16. Don’t buy more than you need.,"We all love a good deal, but you shouldn’t buy something just because it’s on sale or because you have a coupon. If it wasn’t part of your planned grocery list, then you still just spent more money than you were planning to—deal or no deal."
17. Test out your green thumb.,"Okay, I know this won’t work for everyone, but it’s a great way toeat healthy on a budget. Plant your own garden! If you grow your own tomatoes, bell peppers and cauliflower, you won’t have to buy any at the store. You can start small by planting herbs like parsley, cilantro and rosemary right on your kitchen windowsill. If you can’t use your harvest right away, puree it and pour it into ice cube trays to freeze for later."
18. Use apps on your phone.,"When you’re searching for ways to save money on groceries, don’t forget about all thecoupon appsout there! Ibotta, Receipt Hog, Checkout 51 and Target Circle are just a few of the great programs that can help you save."
19. Buy meat only when it’s on sale.,"When you do buy meat, get what’s on sale and build your meal plans around that! Be on the lookout for great bulk deals on meat, and freeze what you won’t use that week. Also, look for cuts of meat that are cheaper alternatives to what you usually buy. Skip the sirloin and grab ground chuck. Pass on the pork chops and pick the pork loin. That way you can have your meat and save money too!"
20. Buy generic.,"Aregeneric brandsreally as good as the name brands? Consumer Reports says most store brands measure up to the name brands in taste and quality—and they’re usually 20–25% lower in price too!3So try it for yourself. Buy some generic groceries, even if you just start small. Get this: When it comes to staples like salt, sugar and baking soda, a lot of chefs buy generic too. And they’re the food experts! So listen to the pros when it comes to how to save money on groceries."
21. If you buy it—use it!,"Every rotten cucumber and moldy peach is like a little stack of cash going right in the trash. It’s the worst! And I feel like even with my meal plan and grocery list, this still happens if I’m not careful—especially with those bananas Ireallyplan on the kids having for snacks all week. Remember: If you buy the bananas, have the kids eat the bananas. Waste less andsave more every monthby being super intentional here."
22. Shop the farmers market at the end of the day.,"Okay, heads up—most things at the farmers market aren’t cheaper. But if you like supporting local farmers and buying fresh foods, shop at the end of the day. Most vendors don’t want to take their food home with them, so get there just before closing time to see what kinds of deals you can score."
23. Preserve and store away.,"When ingredients are overflowing at the farmers market (or in your garden), buy in bulk and preserve them for the winter. You might spend more during the summer with the extra produce and canning jars. But think of it as an investment for a meal a few months ahead. In the winter, you can buy a box of pasta for a couple of bucks and pull a container of your homemade tomato sauce off the shelf. Mix it all up and you have a super cheap, homemade dinner on your hands."
24. Skip the packaging.,"A prepackaged bag of lettuce with a dressing packet and fixings will cost double what a head of lettuce with some simple homemade dressing would. Go for the unpackaged fruits and veggies whenever you can. They’re cheaper and usually healthier too. Yes, you’ll have to spend a little extra time chopping and prepping, but it’s more money back in your wallet. And that’s worth it."
25. Leave the overspenders at home.,"A word to the wise—if you find that your kids are the culprits of adding all those not-on-the-list items to your cart, you might want to leave them at home. Or maybe it’s your spouse who needs to stay far away from the grocery store. Or you! Let the person who’s best at sticking to the list do the actual shopping. Everyone else: Stay home."
How Much Do People Spend on Groceries Each Month?,"Now, let’s talk about how much people tend to spend on this budget line. Thetypical cost of monthly groceriesfor one adult ranges from $249 to $313. And when it comes to a family of four, the average cost for their monthly grocery bill is about $985.4 To you, those averages might seem low, spot on or crazy high. So many factors come into play here, like where you live or any special dietary needs you have. But in any case, you can still be more intentional and save more money on groceries."
Grocery Shopping on a Budget Doesn’t Have to Be Hard,"A few new habits can help you lower your monthly grocery bill, stick to your budget, and meet your money goals faster. That means you’ll have more cash to pay down debt, invest for the future, or save for something fun—like a babysitter and a nice meal out where someone else cooks and cleans up!

Should I Buy a House Now or Wait?,Whether you should buy now or wait depends more on your personal finances than on the housing market. Here’s a breakdown of when you should wait to buy a house and when to pull the trigger:
When to Wait,"You should wait to buy a house if you aren’t financially prepared for homeownership. No matter what the housing market is doing, buying a house is a bad idea if you don’t have your ducks in a row. Specifically, you should wait on buying a house if . . . We know how badly you want to be a homeowner and to start building equity. But if one or more of those statements apply to you,that’swhere you should direct your focus for now. Every day, we talk to folks who bought a house before taking those steps and wound up regretting it because they got stuck with a giant, expensive burden. We wantyourhome to be ablessing."
When to Buy,"If you have checked all those boxes, then you’re ready to hire areal estate agentand get to buying! You may be tempted to wait around for a better interest rate or more affordable home prices, but that’s not a good idea for a couple of reasons. For starters, experts believe home prices will continue to rise this year while interest rates stabilize.1So, if you wait and buy when home prices go up, you’ll be stuck with higher prices. But if you buy now and interest rates happen to drop over the next year or two, you can still take advantage of the lower rates byrefinancing your mortgage. Think of it this way: You date the interest rate but marry the house. Overall, you never want to decide whether to buy a house purely based on what the market is doing. If you’re in good shape with your money, there’s no reason to wait."
Will Mortgage Rates Go Down in 2025?,"Mortgage rates might go down a little in 2025, but not by much.2One reason experts predict this is because the Federal Reserve (also known as the Fed) recently held the federal funds rate steady, instead of making cuts. The federal funds rate influences mortgage rates across the country. In September 2024, the Fed lowered the federal funds rate for the first time in four years. They made three additional cuts to close out the year, plus a smaller one in January 2025.3,4So far, the Fed doesn’t seem to plan on making any significant cuts this year, which means mortgage rates will likely remain unchanged. Even if mortgage rates stay pretty much where they are this year, at least they’re lower than the rates we saw in 2023. The typical rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell from 7.79% at the end of October 2023 to 6.72% at the end of October 2024. And the rate for a 15-year mortgage fell from 7.03% to 5.99% during the same time frame.5Pretty sweet! We’re still a long way away from rates returning to the 2–3% range we saw at the end of 2021, but it’s great to see things trending in the right direction."
What Is the Federal Reserve?,The Federal Reserve is the U.S. central bank that creates money and sets interest rates. Its main goal is to keep the economy running smoothly by having low unemployment and low inflation. Think of a mechanic who tinkers around with a car to make it purr like a kitten—that’s what the Fed is like. And one of its favorite tools isinterest rates.
Why Does the Fed Raise Interest Rates?,"The Fed raises interest rates to encourage people to borrow less, spend less and save more—which should slow down inflation. Now, the Fed doesn’t tell commercial banks what interest rates to charge on loans, but they do influence the banks’ rates by setting a target for thefederal funds rate. That’s the interest rate banks charge to each other for overnight loans, and it influences most other interest rates. So, even though the Federal Reserve doesn’tactuallyset mortgage interest rates, its decisions can still affect your mortgage. For example, when mortgage rates started going down in late 2023, the Fed hadn’t lowered the federal funds rate yet. Banks simply saw what was coming down the road and started lowering interest rates."
The Bottom Line,"No one likes high interest rates, but they’re not the end of the world. This is still a great time to buy a house—you’ll just pay more than you would’ve a few years ago. It’s also a good time to sell a house. And if you already have a fixed-rate mortgage locked in, you’re in good shape too. While it’s always great to have a lower interest rate on your mortgage, that doesn’t mean you have to wait years to buy or sell a house—or to refinance if your current loan just isn’t working for you. You get to decide when to buy a house based on what’s right for you and your family—not the Fed. "

Understanding Medicare Savings Programs (MSPs),"MSPs cover some or all of Medicare parts A and B premiums, deductibles, copays, and coinsurance for people who fall under certain income limits. Administered by Medicaid, these programs are designed to make sure everyone has health insurance coverage. You don’t necessarily have to qualify for Medicaid to get help through an MSP. Medicare and Medicaid are different government programs (Medicare is insurance while Medicaid is financial aid for medical services), but they work together in some cases like with MSPs. Medicare is run by the federal government while Medicaid is run by individual states. This means the rules around MSPs will differ depending on where you live. "
Types of Medicare Savings Programs,"Just like there are different kinds of lettuce . . . you know what, let’s make it cookies . . . talking about Medicare is already too much like eating vegetables. Okay, so just like there are different kinds of sandwich crème cookies—you’ve got the original Oreos, vanilla versions, double crème, weird holiday ones with crazy colors—there are different kinds of MSPs. As you might expect, one will probably fit your situation better than another. "
Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) Program,"This program pays premiums for both parts A and B. It also covers deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. With a QMB, you shouldn’t have to pay for any Medicare-covered services so long as your provider accepts Medicare or is within your Advantage network."
Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB) Program,This program will cover Part B premiums if you qualify.
Qualifying Individual (QI) Program,"This program helps pay for Part B premiums as well. It’s only available to people who don’t qualify for any other kind of Medicaid benefit (but people who take QI assistance can still get help from a different MSP if qualified for it). With QI, there are a limited number of spots, and applications are approved on a first-come, first-served basis. Also, the government gives priority to people who got this benefit the year before."
Qualified Disabled and Working Individuals (QDWI) Program,"You might’ve guessed from the name, but this program is for those with disabilities who’ve lost their disability benefits and free Part A premiums because they’ve gone back to work. So, this MSP just covers Part A premiums."
Eligibility Requirements for MSPs,"As you read above, participation is mainly based on your income and assets or resources (but some states don’t count those). Each program varies slightly, but they all set a limit on how much money you can make to qualify. The limits here are from the federal government. MSPs are run by states, so in some states you may qualify for help even if your income is higher than the federal limits. Check with your state to be sure. To figure out if you’re eligible: Even if it doesn’t look like you’ll qualify based on the income guidelines, go ahead and contact your state. They may have exceptions. "
Application Process,"Because these are state-run programs (Medicaid!), you’ll need to apply through your state. Each state calls their Medicaid office something a little different, but you can find a list of each state’s Medicaid office contact onMedicaid.gov. Keep in mind, you’ll need to prove you’re enrolled in Medicareandprove your income (this includes any Social Security benefits you’re getting) along with any assets or resources your state counts. Documents you’ll need: Navigating these programs and applications can seem like a maze, but you don’t have to do it alone. There areadvisorswho can help guide you through it for free. "
How MSPs Interact With Other Programs,"Besides the financial help with Medicare premiums, deductibles and copays, you’ll also get access to additional support like Extra Help. (Creative name, huh? Well, it’s also called Medicare Part D Low Income Subsidy or LIS . . . you know what? That’s definitely not better.) This program helps cover the cost of prescription drugs—in 2024, you’ll pay no more than $11.20 for each drug.[5]People who qualify for the QMB, SLMB and QI programs automatically qualify for Extra Help (people using the QDWI program are not eligible). It can work the other way too. Enrollment in Extra Help cansometimeslead to automatic qualification for an MSP (it’s the government—they don’t always do things the fastest or most efficient way). FYI, if you are accepted into an MSP and your income levels and situation make you eligible for full Medicaid benefits, your state is required to tell you. "
Common Challenges in Enrolling in MSPs,"These babies are quite complicated—from eligibility to application, using an MSP can be daunting. One common hurdle is burdensome paperwork for applying and renewing coverage. But you don’t have to rely on some unenthused government worker on the other end of a phone. There are people who can help you. If you think you might struggle with Medicare costs, it’s a good idea to plan ahead for how you’ll get help paying once you enroll. The government can move slowly. So do some of the work ahead by figuring out which MSPs you’ll apply for and what you’ll need on hand to apply. "
Find a Guide,"Like we mentioned earlier, some people qualify for help through an MSP even when they think they won’t. If you’re struggling to pay for Medicare,check with your stateto see if you qualify. Medicare is complicated enough. Adding an MSP onto the pile can make for a real dumpster fire of paperwork, deadlines, eligibility guidelines and ever-changing rules. But using aMedicare advisorcan help cut through the complications. Good ones are trained to know the ins and outs of programs related to Medicare and can make it easier to get the help you need. The good folks at Chapter can find you the right Medicare plan, and they can help you sort through MSPs and navigate using them in conjunction with your Medicare. Chapter advisors are there to help you through every twist and turn of Medicaid—from signing up to using your benefits to making doctor appointments! And it’s all free. "

Budget Categories for Every Month,GivingSavingFoodUtilitiesHousingTransportationInsuranceHealthKidsDebtPetsLifestyle and EntertainmentPersonalMonth Specific
Examples of Monthly Expenses to Include in Your Budget,"What you budget for each month depends on your family and your lifestyle. You’ve also got bothfixed expenses and variable expensesthat change month to month. Here are 51 examples of monthly expenses to include in your budget, organized by budget category. You may not need every single one of these budget lines, but this monthly expenses list will help you get started! I always start my family’s budget with giving (includingtithing10% of our income). It’s the best way to get my head (and heart) straight before I start working through the rest of my budget. Generosity takes the focus off me and shifts it onto thinking about others. And honestly, it helps me start each month feeling way more grateful for what I have. 1. Tithing 2. Charitable giving You need to make saving a priority in your budget. That includes building anemergency fund—$1,000 if you have debt and 3–6 months of expenses once you’re debt-free. You also want to make sure you’re investing 15% of your income for retirement. And if you’ve got a big purchase coming up (like a car or a vacation), use asinking fundto save up for it every month. 3. Emergency fund 4. Retirement savings 5. Large purchases Now that we’ve got giving and saving taken care of, we need to cover your monthly bills. Let’s start with what I call theFour Walls: food, utilities, housing and transportation. For food, make sure groceries and restaurants each have their own budget lines. Because you have to eat—but youdon’thave to eat out. That’s right: Restaurants fit nicely under your food budget category, but theyaren’tan essential expense, and theyaren’tone of the Four Walls. If you need to free up cash for one of theBaby Stepsor get more margin in your budget, this is a great place tocut spendingand save money! 6. Groceries 7. Eating out"
How to Budget for Your Monthly Expenses,"Okay, so you know what budget categories to include and what monthly expenses to expect. Now you need to know how tocreate your monthly budget! Step 1:Write down all your income in a typical month. (If you have anirregular income, put in your lowest estimate. You can bump it up later if you make more!) Step 2:Make a list of all your monthly expenses. (You can always pull up your bank account and take a look at last month’s transactions to get a better idea of what you usually spend.) Step 3:Subtract your expenses from your income—and that number should equal zero. This method is calledzero-based budgeting. Now, a zero-based budget doesn’t mean you have zero dollars in your bank account. (Keep a little buffer of $100–300 in there.) It also doesn’t mean youspendeverything you make. Nope. It simply means you’re givingall your moneya job to do. It means you plan how you give, save, spend and invest all of your income. This way you never get to the end of the month and wonder where all your money went—because you told it exactly where to go. When you budget,youare in control of where every single dollar goes. This gives you confidence that you’re spending and savingwell. If you don’t have a budgeting app yet, tryEveryDollar! It’s how my family makes our monthly budget, and you can get started forfree.

That’s the interest rate banks charge to each other for overnight loans, and it influences most other interest rates. So, even though the Federal Reserve doesn’tactuallyset mortgage interest rates, its decisions can still affect your mortgage. For example, when mortgage rates started going down in late 2023, the Fed hadn’t lowered the federal funds rate yet. Banks simply saw what was coming down the road and started lowering interest rates."
The Bottom Line,"No one likes high interest rates, but they’re not the end of the world. This is still a great time to buy a house—you’ll just pay more than you would’ve a few years ago. It’s also a good time to sell a house. And if you already have a fixed-rate mortgage locked in, you’re in good shape too. While it’s always great to have a lower interest rate on your mortgage, that doesn’t mean you have to wait years to buy or sell a house—or to refinance if your current loan just isn’t working for you. You get to decide when to buy a house based on what’s right for you and your family—not the Fed. "

1. Buying a House When You’re Already in Debt,"Here’s the deal: Debt weighs you down. And if you’re trying to buy a home while you’re forking over hundreds (or thousands) of dollars every month on debt payments, you’ll run into one of three big problems. Either it’ll take youforeverto save a down payment, you’ll wind up taking out a bigger mortgage so you can speed up the process, or you’ll struggle to make your mortgage payments on top of your student loans, car loans and credit card bills—putting you one emergency away from missing a house payment. Heck, you may even run intoall ofthose problems! Paying for a house when you’re in debt is like trying to run a marathon with weights chained to your legs. Making it to the finish line will be a struggle, and you’ll end up way behind on your other money goals—like retiring, traveling or paying for your kids togo to college debt-free—because all your income will be tied up in debt payments. Instead, push pause on the house for now anddump the debtthat’s holding you back."
2. Underestimating Homeownership Costs,"Owning a home is expensive! After buying a house, you’ll have to pay certain bills as long as you live there—likeproperty taxesandHOA fees. Plus, your utility bill will likely go up if you’re upsizing from an apartment. That’s even more reason to get out of debt before you buy. And it’s only a matter of time before your home needs repairs. So don’t make the mistake of spending all your savings when you buy a home. You’ll need some money left to fix stuff when it breaks. That’s why you should save up anemergency fundof 3–6 months of your typical expenses before buying a housein additionto your down payment and closing costs. That way, you’ll be able to cover emergencies without breaking a sweat (or using a credit card)."
3. Buying a House You Can’t Afford,"Before you look for your dream home, figure outhow much house you can afford. Your monthly mortgage payment should be 25% or less of your take-home pay—including property taxes, homeowners insurance, private mortgage insurance (PMI) and HOA fees. Try ourMortgage Calculatorto see what your monthly payment could look like based on your budget."
4. Making Too Small of a Down Payment,"A small down payment leads to bigger monthly payments and more debt overall. Bad plan! Instead, aim to put down 20% of your home’s total value. That may seem like a lot, but putting that much down means you won’t have to pay PMI. Those monthly fees can add up quickly, and you’re only paying to protect the lender in case you stop making payments—it’s not insurance for you! If you’re a first-time home buyer, a 5–10% down payment is okay too, but be ready to pay PMI. And stay far away from FHA and VA loans and all their fees!"
5. Getting the Wrong Mortgage,"To put it bluntly, most types of mortgages suck. Here are some of the worst options: So, what’s therightkind of home loan? A15-year fixed-rate conventional mortgage. You’ll pay less interest and fewer fees with a 15-year fixed-rate conventional loan than with any other mortgage. And you’ll pay off your home faster! "
6. Skipping Mortgage Preapproval,"When you apply for a mortgage, lenders don’t just hand you the money. There’s a whole approval process, and you should go through itbeforeyou start shopping. Why? A mortgage preapproval letter tells the seller you’re serious and speeds up the paperwork. So getting preapproved (not just prequalified) gives you a leg up on the competition. Trust us, it’s worth the time! Ready to get preapproved? Talk to our friends atChurchill Mortgage."
7. Shopping Without a Real Estate Agent,"With so many real estate apps and websites available, you might think you don’t need a real estate agent to buy a house. But real estateagents do a lot to help you, like: Don’t just go with the first agent you talk to, though. Try interviewing at least three agents, then pick the one you’re most comfortable with. You don’t want to put such a big transaction in the hands of someone who acts like a slimy used-car salesman—or your Aunt Kim’s neighbor Chuck, who just got his real estate license. You can connect with top-performing real estate agents in your local area through our freeRamseyTrusted®program."
8. Making Emotional Decisions,"Picture this: You go to an open house and quickly fall in love with the home. It’s got the perfect backyard for the dog, enough bedrooms for each of the kids, and those granite countertops you’ve always dreamed of. But when you sit down to do the math, you realize it’s out of your budget. So you start to make some compromises in your head.Maybe we should increase our budget. Hey, we can’t afford this home now, but we’ll surely get raises pretty soon. It’ll be worth the extra financial stress. Stop! A thought process like that is a recipe for some major money problems down the road. We get it: Buying a home can be an emotional journey. But you’ve got to stick to your guns and avoid making big decisions based on those emotions. Don’t forget that facts are your friends."
9. Ignoring the Neighborhood,"Your new home’s resale value may not seem important now, especially if you think it’s your forever home. But here’s the reality: Most homeowners only stay in their home for 10 years.1 So be sure to think about resale value when you’re house hunting. The biggest key to picking a home that’s likely to grow in value? Paying attention to the entire neighborhood. For example, you don’t want to buy the most expensive home in the neighborhood. Instead, choose a home that’s in thebottomprice range of its neighborhood—those houses are more likely to be worth more in the future and sell more quickly. You should also ask what developments are planned for the area. Some, like a new school, add value to your property. Others, like a highway cutting through the yard or a nearby trash dump, lower property values."
10. Buying a Home Without an Inspection,"Ahome inspectiononly costs a few hundred bucks, and it’s money well spent. An inspection gives you a thorough report on a home’s structure and its electrical, plumbing, and heating and cooling systems to help you spot potential problems. If the inspection turns up anything wacky, you can decide if you want to buy the home as is, negotiate with the seller to fix problems, reduce the price, or even walk away from the deal. But if you already bought the place? You’re likely stuck with it."
11. Taking on Debt While Closing,"Why is it so important to have enough cash saved up to cover closing costs? Because you don’t want to take onanyextra debt at the end of the buying process. That’s right—getting a second loan for closing costs is a big mistake. And youdefinitelydon’t want to go out and buy a whole bunch of furniture on credit. For starters, it adds an extra payment on top of your house payment. Talk about a recipe for financial stress! And taking on extra debt while you’re closing changes your credit score, which sends your mortgage approval back to the drawing board and delays the closing process."
12. Not Budgeting for Closing Costs and Moving Expenses,"Everyone knows you need to save up a down payment before buying a house, but lots of people forget about two other big expenses involved in becoming a homeowner: closing costs and moving expenses. Buyers’ closing costs are typically 3–4% of the home’s value.2For a $300,000 home, that’s another $9,000–12,000 you’ll pay to third parties like the lender, home inspector, appraiser and title attorney. When it comes to moving expenses,the average cost to move less than 100 miles is around $1,700.3That number can go way up if you’re moving even farther. Plan for these costs, and don’t cheat by stealing from your down payment amount or emergency fund. You’ll need that money too! "

Before You Sell the House,"Depending on how big your debt is, it’s true that the proceeds from a home sale will probably take a huge bite out of your debt—or even pay it off. That sounds great! However, because selling your home is such a huge (and expensive) process, it’s not something to go into on a whim. That’s why, when it comes to paying off debt, selling your house should always be a last resort. In other words, you should exhaust all the alternatives before considering it. So, before you think about selling your home to pay off debt, ask yourself a few questions—and be honest: When you’ve exhausted all those options, have been at it for a while, and are still wanting (or needing) to put more toward debt, selling your home might be an option. But even then, there are two circumstances where it would actually make sense."
Your Mortgage Payment Is Way Too Big,"These days, mortgage payments can be pretty big. In fact, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA), the median mortgage payment in the U.S. is $2,140.1And if it’s too big, it can keep you from making progress on your debt. Ideally, your mortgage payment should be no more than 25% of your monthly take-home pay. If half of your income gets swallowed up by your mortgage every month, it’s a no-brainer—there’s nothing left to throw at debt. Cutting your housing budget down to size is the only way you’ll ever make progress. Let’s look at an example. Frank and Sheryl Smith bring home $4,900 a month and owe $40,000 in student loans. Their mortgage costs $2,200 a month—a whopping 45% of their take-home pay. At this rate, they can only afford to put $350 a month toward their student loan debt. So, the Smiths decide it’s time to sell their home and get in touch with areal estate agent. Because they hadn’t built up very much equity in the short time they were in their house, the Smiths make $20,000 off the sale when all is said and done. And that chunk of money goes directly toward their student loan balance. Frank and Sheryl don’t have any cash toput downon a new home. Going back torentingisn’t ideal, but it’s worth a temporary sacrifice to get their financial feet back on the ground.The Smiths find a place to rent for $1,700 a month. That budget change enables them to add an extra $500 to their student loan payment each month. Instead of taking five years to pay off debt, the Smiths are on track to kick Sallie Mae to the curb in just 24 months. And that’s not even counting any raises they get or temporary increases in income from side gigs and selling stuff. Not to mention the interest they’ll be saving on that loan by paying it off earlier."
You’re Considering Moving Anyway,"It’s true that your home holds a lot of emotional value. There’s no need to make a drastic move if you love your home and your mortgage payment isn’t holding you back. Like we said earlier, just tighten up spending in other areas and focus on attacking that debt. You can find other ways to turbocharge your progress without uprooting your family. But if selling your home was already on your to-do list, there’s an important question to consider: Will it help or hurt your money situation? The answer takes a little calculation as well as our new (hypothetical) friends, Frank and Cheryl. Now let’s see how far $168,500 could go for the Smiths if they owe $40,000 in debt and want todownsize their home. And while they’re at it, why not use that chunk of change to power through the first threeRamsey Baby Stepsto financial peace in one fell swoop? They could: Of course, everyone’s financial situation is different. What works for the Smiths may not work for you. That’s why it’s important to crunch your own numbers before making a big decision."

What is a 50-year mortgage?,"Like Chinese water torture, a 50-year mortgage is a very long, very slow form of paying off your house. The 50-year mortgage first arrived in southern California, where houses were getting expensive and people were looking for creative ways to lower their monthly mortgage payments."
How does the 50-year mortgage work?,"Like its cousins the 15- and 30-year mortgages, the 50-year mortgage is a fixed-rate mortgage, meaning the interest rate stays the same for the (long) life of the loan. You’ll pay both principal and interest every month, and…if you’re still alive at the end of your 50-year loan period, you’ll officially be a homeowner."
Why would anyone choose a 50-year mortgage?,"There’s no good reason to put yourself into debt for that much time! But people do it, and they usually do it for one of these three reasons:"
1. You have low monthly payments.,The most common reason people lock themselves into a 50-year mortgage is to reduce their monthly payments. The idea is to spread the mortgage over a longer period of time so you can pay less each month than you would with a shorter-term loan.
2. You can buy a bigger house . . . but it’s more than you can actually afford.,"Be honest with yourself here. If you have to take out a 50-year mortgage to lower your monthly payments, you’re definitely trying to borrow more than youshould. The interest rate is also significantly high, so you’re paying afortunein interest alone. You need to take a look athow much house you can really affordand reconsider your mortgage options."
3. You can start building equity and refinance later.,"Some people want to buy a house, but they aren’t in good enough financial shape to qualify for a 15-year conventional loan. So they sign up for a 50-year mortgage and hope their circumstances will change. Maybe they think they’ll get a promotion and refinance the home later or they’ll build equity and sell the house when the market is hotter. They plan to make small payments now, then one large payment later. Folks—this is broke people’s logic! If you can’t afford a house now, you should rent. Period. It’s not a waste of money. It’s a chance for you to pay off your debt,save for a strong down payment, and get financially ready for a better mortgage. Read on to learn why a 50-year mortgage is such a bad investment."
How much are you really paying for a 50-year mortgage?,"Sure, when you take out a 50-year mortgage, your monthly payments will be lower. But you’re extending your mortgage over a longer period of time, so you’re going to paywaymore in interest. How much more? Let’s say you take out a 50-year mortgage for $200,000 at 6% interest. Your monthly payments would be $1,053 (just including principal and interest), but your interest paid over the life of the loan would be a little higher than $430,000! Now, let’s say you take out that same $200,000 at a 4.5% interest rate on a 15-year mortgage. (You probably noticed our example rate for a 15-year mortgage is much lower. More on that below.) Your monthly payments would be $1,530 (again, just principal and interest). So even though you’re paying $500 more a month, your total interest paid with a 15-year mortgage would be just a little over $100,000. That’s right—the 50-year mortgage would cost you over $330,000 more in interest than the 15-year mortgage. That’sliterallyenough for another house!"
What are the drawbacks of a 50-year mortgage?,"There are hundreds of reasons not to put yourself in debt for 50 years. But for the sake of time, let’s just go over four."
1. You’re paying back a loan for 50 years.,"It’s 50 years, people. Fifty years! Do you really want your grandchildren to pay off their mortgages before you finish payingyours? Serious question here."
"2. As mentioned, you end up paying alotmore in interest.","In exchange for more time to pay off your loan, lenders will charge you a higher interest rate. Combine that interest rate (and your borrowing fees) with 50 years and—TA-DA!—you have one very expensive loan."
3. You build equity slowly . . .tooslowly.,"People sometimes take out a 50-year mortgage because they want to start building equity. But what most folks don’t realize is that because they’re making smaller monthly payments, they’re actually building equity at a rate that’sslower than molasses."
4. You won’t really own a house for 50 years!,"It’s worth repeating, butwe’re talking about half a century of debt!Need we say more? It’s going to take you longer to own your home outright compared to someone with a shorter-term mortgage. You’ll be stuck in an interest cycle that steals away cash from other parts of your future."
What kind of mortgage should you really get?,"First off, let’s make something clear—the sooner you can pay off your mortgage, the sooner you can feel the weight of the loan lifted, free your budget, and officially own your home! We believe everyone can have this kind of financial freedom, which is why we only recommend the best mortgage option out there:the 15-year conventional mortgage. You’ll save thousands in interest and you’ll get out of debt faster. You don’t have to put yourself in debt for 50 years just to own a house! You can get a home the right way—by getting out of debt now, building an emergency fund of six months of expenses, and saving at least a 10% down payment (although 20% is best). With this financial foundation in place, you’ll be ready to take out a mortgage with a monthly payment that’s no more than 25% of your take-home pay. If you want to get a mortgage the right way, talk to a mortgage professional you can trust. Check out Churchill Mortgage.

15-Year vs. 30-Year Mortgage: How Are They Different?,"Okay, let’s get the most obvious difference out of the way first. You’ll pay off a 30-year mortgage in 30 years, while you’ll pay off a 15-year in 15 years. No surprises there, right? Here are a few more key differences. 30-year mortgage:Because a30-year mortgagehas a longer term, your monthly payments will be lower and your interest rate on the loan will be higher. So, over a 30-year term, you’ll pay less money each month, but you’ll also make payments for twice as long and give the bank thousands more in interest. 15-year mortgage:A15-year mortgagehas higher monthly payments, but because the interest rate on a 15-year mortgage is lower and you’re paying off the principal faster, you’ll pay a lot less in interest over the life of the loan. Plus, you’ll pay off your house twice as fast."
15- vs. 30-Year Mortgage Comparison,"Let’s look at an example. Suppose you want to buy a $400,000 house and have a healthy 20%down payment($80,000). That means you need a mortgage for $320,000. Here’s what your expenses would look like on a $320,000 home loan—whether you chose a 15-year mortgage or a 30-year mortgage:  FYI: We calculated the numbers for both monthly payments on ourMortgage Calculatorusing principal and interest only. Then, we calculated the total interest and total mortgage amounts on ourMortgage Payoff Calculator. As you can see, the 30-year mortgage would have you paying over $260,000 (that’s about 55%) more than you’d pay with a 15-year mortgage! Sure, itfeelsnice on the front end to save over $600 a month by choosing the 30-year mortgage—but your interest rate will be higher, and you’ll spend twice as much time in debt! Is a slightly cheaper mortgage payment on the front-end worth $260,000 more on the back end? No way!"
Do You Pay More Interest on a 15- or 30-Year Mortgage?,"The average interest rate for a 30-year mortgage has been around 0.5–1%higherthan a 15-year mortgage for the past several years.1,2 One percentage point may not seem like a huge difference—but keep in mind, a 30-year mortgage has you paying that difference fortwicethe amount of time compared to a 15-year mortgage. That’s why the 30-year mortgage ends up being so much more expensive."
What’s a Disadvantage of Getting a 15-Year Mortgage Instead of a 30-Year Mortgage?,"The only downside to a 15-year mortgage compared to a 30-year mortgage is that it comes with a higher monthly payment. But really, that’s a good thing! With the higher monthly payment on a 15-year mortgage, more of your money goes toward paying off the principal amount of your loan—instead of getting thrown away on interest. That’s how the 15-year mortgage allows you to pay off your loan in half the time compared to a 30-year mortgage—and avoid a mountain of interest payments. Keep in mind, you never want a mortgage with a monthly payment that’s more than25% of your monthly take-home pay—otherwise, you’d be house poor! That 25% limit includes principal, interest, property taxes, home insurance, private mortgage insurance (PMI), and homeowners association (HOA) fees. If a 15-year mortgage has you going over that 25% limit, you might be tempted to choose a 30-year mortgage to lower the monthly payment. But you’re really just trying to buy a house you can’t truly afford. A 30-year mortgage isn’t worth it! Instead, try one of these ideas to keep the monthly payment on your 15-year mortgage within the 25% limit:"
Is It Cheaper to Pay Off a 30-Year Mortgage in 15 Years?,"Some people get a 30-year mortgage, thinking they’ll pay it off in 15 years. If you did that, you’d save yourself 15 years of interest payments. But doing that is really no different than choosing a 15-year mortgage in the first place. Besides that, choosing to make those extra payments would be up to you. Not to mention that, as we talked about earlier, the interest rate for a 30-year mortgage is higher than a 15-year mortgage. Good intentions aside, this rarely happens. Why? Because life happens instead. You might decide to keep that extra payment and take a vacation. Or maybe it’s time to upgrade your kitchen. What about a new wardrobe? Whatever it is, there’s always a reason to spend that money somewhere else. When you have a 15-year mortgage from the beginning, you won’t be tempted to use that money for something else. You’ve got built-in accountability to get your house paid off fast!"
Why Choose a 15-Year Mortgage Over a 30-Year Mortgage?,Here are the main reasons we teach home buyers to choose a 15-year mortgage instead of a 30-year mortgage:
You’ll save tens of thousands of dollars.,"Remember our example from earlier? That 30-year mortgage would cost over $260,000 (55%) more than a 15-year mortgage. Imagine what you could do with hundreds of thousands of extra dollars in your pocket by choosing a 15-year mortgage!"
You’ll build equity in your home faster.,"One way to buildequity(the value of your home minus what you owe on it) is to pay back the principal balance of your loan, rather than just the interest. Since you’re making bigger monthly payments on a 15-year mortgage, you’ll pay down the interest a lot faster, which means more of your payment will go to the principal every month. On the flip side, the smaller monthly payments of a 30-year mortgage will have you paying down the interest a lot slower. So less of your monthly payment will go to the principal."
You’ll pay off your house in half the time.,"Guess what? If you get a 15-year mortgage, it’ll be paid off in 15 years. Why would you choose to be in debt for 30 years if you could knock it out in only 15 years? Just imagine what you could do with that extra money every month when your mortgage is paid off. That’s when the real fun begins! With no debt standing in your way, you can live and give like no one else."
Does Ramsey Recommend a 15-Year Mortgage?,"For decades, we’ve been telling the millions of listeners who tune in toThe Ramsey Showthe best way to buy a house is with cash.

Should I Sell My House Now or Wait?,"When deciding whether to sell your home, your personal situation should take center stage. Market conditions are onlypartof the picture, and they’re not even the most important. What does that mean for you? It means you should only sell your house if the marketandyour individual situation line up. In other words, you’ll want to make sure you’re emotionally and financially prepared before pulling the trigger. We’ll discuss exactly what that looks like in the next section. If you'rewondering about thehousing market, the key stat for sellers to keep in mind is inventory. Just like anything else that gets bought and sold, housing prices in the U.S. (or anywhere else) depend on supply and demand. And when supply is low and demand is high, prices go up. That’s exactly where the housing market is right now. While inventory is growing across the U.S., it’s not happening fast enough to keep up with increasing demand—which means home prices will continue rising. For reference, there were 24.6% more homes up for sale across the country in January 2025 than the year before, but the total was still 24.8% lower than the pre-COVID average from 2017–2019.1"
When to Sell Your House,"So, how do you know when it’s a good idea to sell based on your individual situation? Here’s a look at seven signs you should sell your house."
1. You’ve got equity on your side.,"What is equity, you ask? It’s simply the amount you have left to pay on your mortgage subtracted from the market value of your home. The difference is your home equity. Easy math! How much equity should you have before you sell your house? At the very least, you want to have enough equity to pay off your current mortgage, plusenough left over to make a 20% down payment on your next home so you can avoid payingprivate mortgage insurance(PMI). If you can make enough profit to also cover closing costs, moving expenses or a larger down payment, that’s even better! Youdefinitelydon’t want to sell your home when you have negative equity, and breaking even on a home sale isn’t a whole lot better. If you’re in either situation, you shouldn’t sell your house unless you’re trying to avoidbankruptcyorforeclosure."
2. It’ll improve your financial situation.,"As long as selling your house won’thurtyour financial situation, you’re probably in a good spot to sell. But wouldn’t it be nice if selling your house actuallyimprovedyour financial situation? For lots of folks, improving their financial situation is the entire reason they sell their house. A popular way to make that happen isdownsizing. Imagine you own a larger home worth $485,000 and you have $200,000 worth of equity. If you downsized by selling that house and buying a smaller one for $300,000, you’d likely cut your monthly payment in half. You’d alsobe nearly $200,000 closer to paying off your home and being completely debt-free. Sounds exciting, huh? Other times, people get so intense about paying off their consumer debt—things like credit cards, student loans and car payments—that they sell their house to make it happen. They use their equity to pay off all their debt, and they rent while saving up a down payment to buy another house. There are lots of ways selling your home can improve your financial situation, and that’s a great reason to sell. But if selling your house would make your financial situationworse—either by sinking you further into debt or drastically increasing your payments—stay put. Keep this in mind too: With interest rates getting crazy high over the last couple of years, buying a new house and getting a new mortgage will likely stick you with a higher interest rate—potentiallytwiceas high. Even if you’re downsizing, double-check that your budget can absorb that extra blow."
3. You have a new place to live.,"Before packing your bags and heading out the door of your house, you should make sure you have a new place to live. But here’s the deal: You shouldn’tbuya new house before selling the one you currently live in. If it takes longer than you expect for your current home to sell, doubling up on mortgage payments will make your budget way too tight. Plus, qualifying for a new mortgage could be tricky when you’ve already got one outstanding. Luckily, there are plenty of great options to bridge the gap when you’re buying and selling at the same time so you don’t wind up with two house payments at once. You could rent on a short-term lease, or you could move in with family for a little bit. Other options include a rent-back agreement (you give whoever buys your home a discount so you can live in it a little longer) and acontract contingency(you make the purchase of your new home contingent on the sale of your old one)."
4. You can afford the move.,"Moving ain’t free, folks! (Unless you’re moving across the street, in which case you and some friends can probably handle everything with some elbow grease and a dolly.) But seriously, there are usually several costs involved with moving. For example, you’ll have to pay for transportation from your current address to your new one—whether that means buying gas or a plane ticket. You also may want to hire a moving and storage service so you don’t have to shove all your stuff into the back of a minivan (bad idea). On top of moving costs, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to put a little bit of cash toward staging your home—a great way to make it sell faster and for more money. You’ll be able to do most of thehome-stagingwork by yourself, but you may need to buy some materials."
5. You’re emotionally ready to sell.,"Just because thenumberssay you shouldsell your house, that doesn’t mean it’s the best time to actually do it. Don’t forget—selling your home is an emotional issue too. Before you plant that For Sale sign in the front yard, take a minute to ask yourself these questions to make sure you’re emotionally ready to sell: Don’t get us wrong—we’re not trying to talk you out of selling your home! We just want you to be completely ready when you do decide to move on to the next stage of your family’s life. One more thing: If you’verecently lost a loved one, remember it’s wise to give yourself some time—at least six months—before you decide if you should sell your house. The house will still be there, and you’ll be able to make a better decision from a clearer mental space."
6. The market works in your favor.,"No one canpredict how the housing marketwill perform with 100% accuracy, but youcanget a good idea of what you might experience when selling your home. We took a look at the national real estate market earlier, but the real estate trends in your local area could be a little different from the rest of the country. A good real estate agent will be able to help you understand all of that, especially if you ask the right questions. For example, you can ask a real estate agent if the number of homes for sale in your area has been going up or down in the past month or so. If supply is decreasing, competition among buyers might be higher when your home goes on the market. That means you can probably sell your house for more money and have plenty of offers to choose from. On the flip side, if housing supply is increasing, you could be the one competing for buyers’ attention. You’ll also want to consider the time of year. There are pros and cons to selling in any season of the year. But for the most part, thebest time to sell a homeis in the spring—which is when the highest number of homes are sold each year. In 2024, the total number of existing home sales ramped up from 234,000 homes sold in January before reaching a peak of 405,000 homes in May.2This annual trend is usually due to a dramatic increase in buyer demand. The nicer weather makes for better home showings, and family buyers are motivated to settle into a new home before their kiddos start another school year. But remember: The market and time of year are only part of the equation when deciding whether to sell, and they’re not the most important part."
7. You have a rock-star real estate agent.,"Maybe all the signs are saying it’s time to get your home on the market. If so, that’s great! But there’s one more thing you need to truly be ready to sell: a real estate agent. And not just any ol’ agent. You need an absolute rock star of an agent if you want to sell for top dollar. Why? Here are some of the ways a greatreal estate agent serves you: That’s a lot of responsibility! And it’s why finding a top-performing agent who knows your market is a must."

Option 1: Pay Off Your Debt,"I know that telling people they should be debt-free before buying a house isn’t the most popular advice out there. But here’s the truth, you guys: The main reason lots of people can’t afford to buy a house is becausewaytoo much of their paycheck every month is going toward payments on cars, student loans, credit cards, or all of the above. Let’s crunch a few numbers to see why that’s such a problem. The average payment for a new car is over $700, and the average student loan payment is nearly $400.2,3That means the typical person driving a car they bought brand new off the lot who also has student loans is spending $1,100 a month just on debt payments. That’sinsane! When you’re already making such big payments every month, it’s almost impossible to fit a house into your budget. That’s why focusing onpaying off your debtbeforebuying a house is such a good idea—it’s a major step toward making homeownership more affordable. To get started, list your debts from smallest to largest, regardless of interest rate. Then, start putting as much money as possible toward your smallest debt every month while making minimum payments on the rest—we call this the debt snowball. Once your smallest debt is gone, take what you were paying on it and add that to your payment on the next-smallest debt until it’s gone too. Repeat the cycle until each debt is paid in full and you’re completely debt-free!"
Option 2: Relocate to a More Affordable Area,"Another option if you can’t afford your housing market is to move to a different one. Believe me, I know moving to a new city can be scary, especially if you’re comfortable right where you are. But if buying a house is really important to you, you may have to face your fears and get a little uncomfortable. Luckily, you may not have to move very far to see a major discount in the cost of buying a house. After all, lots of expensive major metropolitan areas have much cheaper cities or suburbs within an hour’s drive. Take my hometown of Nashville for example, where the median home listing price is around $640,000. While that’s a super high number, you can find much more affordable houses in nearby cities like Murfreesboro ($480,000 median listing price), Columbia ($440,000), and Goodlettsville ($450,000).4 A longer commute may be inconvenient, but it may also be your ticket to affording a home. You can ask areal estate agentfor advice about how to target your search to areas you can afford."
Option 3: Increase Your Income,"You can also make homeownership more affordable byincreasing your income. After all, if the amount of money you have coming in each month goes up, the amount you can afford to spend on a home also goes up. There are all sorts of ways to increase your income. Some of the best are . . . If you’re planning to increase your income by finding a new job, figure out the minimum salary you’ll need to buy a house before you start your search. Your monthly house payment (including principal, interest, insurance and HOA fees) should be no more than 25% of your take-home pay. I recommend this percentage so you’re not house poor when most of your paycheck goes toward the mortgage."
Option 4: Keep Saving Money,"Because home prices are so expensive these days, it’s going to take longer to save up enough money to buy a home. And you know what? That’s okay. It’s much better to rent for a while and get in a good place with your money than to have a house consume your whole world. And there’s no shame inrenting, guys. It helps you build up your savings—and patience. Plus, you get to call the landlord when something breaks instead of spending your hard-earned money to fix it! If you want to buy a home in a pricey market, waiting and continuing to save money may be your smartest move. Your area may seem more affordable three years from now when you have ahefty down payment saved! By the way, you should also save up a fullemergency fundworth 3–6 months of your typical expenses before buying a house. This is inadditionto the amount you save for a down payment. "
Option 5: Reset Your Expectations,"Another option is to revisit your must-have list. A remodeled four-bedroom Craftsman home on an acre lot might be out of your price range, so think about what you can change. A three-bedroom home, a half-acre lot, or a ranch-style house that needs a little work could be a perfect fit for your budget. And remember, your first home won’t be your forever home. It doesn’t need to have everything on your wish list because you’re probably going to move eventually anyway. Letting go of the idea of a luxury kitchen or gleaming hardwood floors might be tough, but it’s worth it to avoid getting in over your head financially. Don’t forget, you can always upgrade your home’s features down the road. When you work with areal estate agentto get your expectations in line with what you can afford, you’ll be surprised to find out you still have some great options!"
What Not to Do When You Can’t Afford the Housing Market,"Some people, specifically first-time home buyers, manage to afford a house by taking advantage of “creative” financing (aka terrible mortgage options, likeVAandFHA loans) or spending way too much money. That may be how some people are buying houses right now, but don’t do it! Buying a house you can’t actually afford puts you on the fast track to going broke. When you really want something, logic sometimes goes out the window. And I know you mightreallywant a house right now. But don’t let that blind you into making a big financial mistake—like buying a home you can’t afford. Or even worse, falling for terrible programs likerent-to-own, seller financing, or anadjustable-rate mortgage. Stay far away from those, and above all, stick to yourbudget!"
Defining Your Financial Boundaries,"Before you look for homes, you have to knowhow much house you can really afford. That number should be based on your financial situation, not pressure caused by the rising prices in your housing market or what might be trending on social media. If you can’t pay cash for your home, the next best option is getting the right mortgage loan. Follow these guidelines: Our freeMortgage Calculatorcan help you figure out the home prices that’ll fit your budget. And if you’re married, make sure you and your spouse are on the same page about what you want in a house. Then be prepared: A lender will probably approve you for a much higher amount than you can afford. But just because youqualifyfor more money doesn’t mean you can afford to take it. Stick to the 25% rule, and you’ll be golden. Once you know what affordability looks like for you, share your boundaries with your real estate agent. And don’t budge, guys! (Remember, they work foryou.)"
What to Think About When Buying a House (by Age),"Okay, first, I want to be very clear: No matter how old you are, I always recommend the same home-buying financial boundaries we just looked at. But let’s face it—life changes pretty fast. One day, you’re young and carefree. The next, you’re cruising along in a minivan singing “Hakuna Matata.” And soon after that, you’re at your own retirement party. So, let’s talk about what affording a house looks like for your generation—and how you can use your stage of life to your advantage."
Baby Boomers,"As a baby boomer, you might be looking for a house because you want to downsize or move closer to your adorable grandkids. You have a huge advantage in the housing market because you’ve had a lifetime to build up equity in your current house. You can use that equity wisely byselling your current homeand paying cash for something smaller. Don’t have much (or any) equity? Think carefully about how you plan to pay for your new home. After all, you don’t want your mortgage to take up too much of your income—or keep you from retiring."
Generation X,"You’re about halfway through your career, the kids are growing up and heading off to college or trade school, and it feels like the right time to move. The best part is you’ve got 10–20 years left in the workforce, so you can comfortably pay off a 15-year mortgage just in time for retirement! The trick here is to make sure your new home doesn’t put your financial future at risk. You should stillput yourself in a good position to retire—without risking the kids’ college funds."
Millennials,"Millennials are building their careers and families. You might feel like you’ll never be able to afford a house by the time you’re done paying for groceries and diapers. But you can. Your generation is now the backbone of the American workforce—so you’ve got tons of opportunities to earn money and save for a home. Your earning power is a huge advantage, but keep in mind, it doesn’t mean you have to buyright now. Don’t rush into a purchase you feel pressured to make. First,take control of your money—then you’ll be able to afford a house."
Generation Z,"Okay, I’m super impressed you’re already thinking about how to afford a house! Your biggest advantage is you’ve got loads of time, which is a good reason youshouldn’tbuy just yet. It’s smart to wait until you have a good idea where your career, spouse and passions might take you. But you can start taking steps to buy a house in a few years. The best way to do that is by paying off your debt, saving up a strong down payment, and choosing an affordable area to live in."
You’ve Got This!,"Like I said earlier, it’s really easy to feel hopeless when you look at how expensive homes have gotten over the last few years. But if you use these strategies and stay within the boundaries we just went over, youcanmake homeownership part of your future. I’m cheering you on! "

How to Pay Off Your Mortgage Faster: 5 Tips,"Now, let’s take a beat and look at some other financial goals you need to prioritize ahead of getting rid of your mortgage. Before you start paying off your house faster, there are four things I want you to do: If you haven’t checked all four of those boxes, thenthat’swhere you should focus your attention for now. But if youhaveaccomplished those goals, you’re ready to start taking steps toward paying off your house early. Exciting! Let’s go over five not-so-secret butsuperhelpful tips for making that happen."
1. Make extra house payments.,"Okay, you probably don’t need me to tell you that every dollar you throw at your mortgage payment puts a bigger dent in your principal balance. And that means if you make justoneextra payment annually, you’ll knockyearsoff the term of your mortgage—plus save thousands of dollars in interest. How does that work? Let’s crunch the numbers. We’ll say you have a $240,000, 30-year mortgage with a 7% interest rate and a monthly payment of $1,597 for your principal and interest. If you made an extra payment just once everyquarter, you’d pay off your house nearly 15 years early! That would mean cutting the length of your mortgage in half and saving a whopping $184,000 in interest along the way. If you want to see how much time and money you’d save making extra house payments in your specific situation, check out our freemortgage payoff calculator. But before you start making those extra payments, let’s go over some ground rules:"
2. Make extra room in your budget.,"You may have read that last section and thought,But I don’t have any extra money to put toward my house payments!Hang on—you can probably find more money in your budget each month than you realize. Now, if you aren’t alreadymaking a budgetevery month, start there. Write down your income, list your expenses, subtract your expenses from your income to make sure you aren’t overspending, then track your spending during the month to make sure you’re staying on target. If youareliving on a budget—or once you make your first one—here are some adjustments you can make to free up money for paying off your house early."
3. Refinance (or pretend you did).,"Another way to pay off your mortgage early is to trade it in for a new loan with a lower interest rate or a shorter term (or both)—like a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage. Let’s see how this would affect our earlier example—a 30-year $240,000 mortgage with a 7% interest rate. If you kept the 30-year mortgage and made all your payments on schedule for those three decades, you’ll pay about $335,000 in total interest over the life of the loan. But if you switch to a 15-year mortgage with a lower rate of 6.5%, you’ll save close to $200,000—and you’ll pay off your home inhalfthe time! Sure, a15-year mortgagewill come with a bigger monthly payment. But if you can comfortably fit it within your monthly budget (meaning the payment is at or below 25% of your take-home pay), it’ll totally be worth it. And don’t forget, you’ll likely have boosted your income or lowered your cost of living from the time you first took out your mortgage—in that case, you’d definitely be able to handle the bigger payment. If you want to refinance to a mortgage you can pay off fast, talk to an expert at Churchill Mortgage. Our team at Ramsey has worked with Churchill Mortgage for years, and their mortgage experts will show you the true cost—and savings—of each loan option. They’ll also coach you to make the best decision based on your budget and goals. Connect with a mortgage expert you can trust! If you already have a low interest rate on a 30-year loan, don’t worry about refinancing. Go ahead and treat your 30-year mortgage like a 15-year mortgage by upping your monthly payment."
4. Downsize.,"Downsizing your housemay sound like a drastic step. But if you’re determined to pay off your mortgage faster, consider selling your larger home and using the profits to buy a smaller, less expensive house. With the profits from selling your bigger house, you may be able to pay 100% cash for your new home. But even if you do have to get a small mortgage, you’ll still reduce your debt and wind up with lower payments. Remember though: Your goal is to getridof that new mortgage as quickly as possible. So use the smaller balance and lower payments you get from downsizing to accelerate paying off your home. This isn’t an excuse to pocket money in the short-term and delay your payoff. If you think downsizing your home makes sense for your situation and you’re ready to get the process started, your first step should be hiring a top-notch real estate agent who can help you sell your current house and buy a new one. You can find one in your area through our RamseyTrusted program, which matches you with pros our team has vetted to make sure they understand how important it is to buy a home you can afford. They won’t pressure you to consider homes that’ll bust your budget. Connect with a RamseyTrusted agent today."
5. Put extra income toward your mortgage.,"You know what a lot of people do when they start making more money from araise,promotionor bonus? They startspendingmore money, and it can happen automatically if you’re not paying attention. This is a sneaky little trend calledlifestyle creep. It’s not surprising that so many fall into that trap, since it’s really tempting to see extra income as an opportunity to spend more. But if you want to pay off your house early, one of the most effective steps you can take is to treat your income boosts as chances tosavemore. To get really intense about knocking down your mortgage payment, put allyour extra income toward your home loan. That means bonuses, raises,profit sharing, holiday gifts—yep, all of it. It’s more than okay to treat yourself from time to time (I still want you to enjoy your money for other things), but don’t let the temptation of lifestyle creep take over. One of my favorite Bible verses, 1 Timothy 6:6 (NIV) teaches, “Godliness with contentment is great gain.” If you keep an attitude ofcontentment, you won’t need to increase your lifestyle to feel joy and satisfaction about where you are in life—you’ll already have it. And in this case, your “great gain” could wind up being the opportunity to pay off your mortgage faster."
You’ve Got This!,"You know what happens when you pay off your house and the bank doesn’t own it anymore? The grass feels different under your feet when you step onto the lawn. It’s the feeling of freedom. And if you follow these five tips over time, I know you’ll be able to experience that feeling. You’ll pay off your mortgage ahead of schedule, and you’ll get debt out of your life for good. Think about how good that’ll feel! If you want to knowwhenthat day will come, our freemortgage payoff calculatorcan give you an estimate based on how much extra money you're putting toward your house each month. "

Is It Better to Rent or Buy?,"The rent-versus-buy debate is nothing new—but it seems to be the question on everyone’s mind lately because the housing marketing has been so crazy the past few years. Here’s the thing I want you to remember, though: Whether it’s better to rent or buy is up to you (as long as your finances are in order) because buying and renting both have pros and cons. Buying a house gives you ownership, privacy and home equity, but the expensive repairs, taxes, interest and insurance can really get you. Renting a home or apartment is lower maintenance and gives you more flexibility to move. But you may have to deal with rent increases, loud neighbors or a grumpy landlord. There’s no doubt owning a home can be a source of prideandfun (who doesn’t want to put those Pinterest home décor boards to good use?), but it’s also a pricey source of stress! That’s why you want to beabsolutely sureyou’re ready tobuy a housebefore you take this big step."
Pros and Cons of Buying and Renting,"Now, these pros and cons don’t change the answer to the question,Should I buy or rent?They just help you prepare for the option that’s right for you. Let’s face it: Even if you’refinancially ready to buy a home, you may not be thinking about repairs down the road. And that trendy apartment you love might come with some nosy neighbors. So, let’s see what’s great (and not so great) about buying and renting."
Renting Cons," There you have it! Whether you’re ready to buy or want to keep renting, you’ve got a better idea of what you’ll be getting yourself into."
Is Renting Always Cheaper?,"Renting an apartment is usually cheaper than buying a house. But renting a house instead of an apartment could cost more than the mortgage payment on that same house. Again, a lot of the price depends on location. If you look at monthly costs alone though, homeownership usually tips the scale to the pricey side because you pay for maintenance, taxes and homeowners insurance on top of your mortgage. Renting an apartment could be a more affordable option if you live in a market where houses are super expensive (looking at you, San Francisco). But there’s a tipping point: If you rent for decades, you could end up payingmorethan if you’d bought a house in the first place. That’s because a house payment will stay the same while rents go up (unless you have anadjustable-rate mortgage, in which case your mortgage goes up too). So, if you’re going to stay put for the long haul, it’s better to buy—especially when you pay off your home."
Am I Ready to Buy a House?,"Before you buy a home, you need to make sure your financial house is in order. That starts with getting out of debt. Next, save an emergency fund of 3–6 months of expenses, and after that, start saving for a down payment. For first-time home buyers, I recommend at least a 5–10% down payment on a15-year fixed-rate mortgage. (Stay far away from FHA and VA loans.) If you can save 20% for a down payment, you won’t have to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI)—which could save you a couple hundred bucks a month. And when you’re deciding what you can spend on a house, make sure your mortgage payment (including principal, interest, property taxes, homeowners insurance, PMI and HOA fees) will be 25% or less of your take-home pay."
Things to Consider When Deciding Whether to Rent or Buy,"Your financial situation is the most important thing to keep in mind when deciding to rent or buy. Because if you’re drowning in debt or don’t have a down payment saved, you’re not in a position to buy a house, bottom line. But if your financesarein good shape, you still need to consider a few other things. Location is a big one! If you want to live in the city or part of town with good schools and crazy expensive homes, renting might be more affordable than buying. Or you could buy a house in a different part of town where prices are more affordable—but you’ll compromise on schools or your commute to work. Here's something else to think about: If you don’t see yourself living in the same city for a few years, don’t buy a home there. You usually want to stay in a house at least three years to avoid losing money when you sell it. And once you buy a home, are you willing and able to maintain it? Mowing grass, cleaning gutters, replacing furnace filters—you’ll either need to do these things yourself or hire someone to do it for you (and that costs money). There’s always something to fix when you own a home! Owning a home is great, but the repair and maintenance costs can really add up. So remember, the monthly rent or mortgage payment isn’t the only expense to consider."
How to Calculate the Cost of Renting vs. Buying a House,"Before deciding whether to rent or buy, let’s look at how to crunch the numbers on both. To figure out the cost of renting, search online for rentals in the neighborhood where you want to live. Rental listings should give you an idea of the cost of rent, plus utilities and other fees. Don’t overlook hidden fees! An apartment complex might tack on parking, elevator or garbage fees. And if you bring Rover along to your rental, you’ll usually have to pay a pet fee too. To figure out the cost of a house, do an online search to get a ballpark price of houses you like and can afford. You can plug those prices and your down payment amount into ourmortgage calculatorto figure out your monthly payment—including principal and interest, taxes, homeowners insurance and HOA dues. This amount should be no more than 25% of your take-home pay. Expect to tack on about $300 a month for utilities like electricity, gas, water and sewer. Internet, streaming services and trash collection will add at least another $100.1 I ran some numbers through our mortgage calculator for a $300,000 home. With a 15-year mortgage (the only type of mortgage I recommend) at 6.25% interest with a 20% down payment, your total monthly payment should be about $2,550 (including taxes, insurance, and HOA dues). And with $400 for utilities and other services, you’re looking at about $3,000 a month. If that number gives you heartburn, you’ll need to look for a cheaper house or keep renting."
3 Reasons You Shouldn’t Buy a House,"I talk to a lot of home buyers, and unfortunately, many of them regret their purchases because they bought for the wrong reason. I don’t want you to fall into the same trap as they did! So here are some reasonsnotto buy a house."
3 Times When You Should Rent,"I want to repeat that renting isnota waste of money. Sure, you’re giving your money to the landlord. But you’re paying to live somewhere. And as long as you’re paying for a place to live, your money is well spent. While I don’t recommend renting as a permanent way of life, there are a few times when it’s better to rent than buy."
Buy or Rent? Make Your Best Choice With a Pro.,"Deciding whether to buy a house isn’t an easy choice. That’s why it’s smart to partner with a pro who can help you navigate your options. If you’re looking for a local real estate agent who will offer you trustworthy advice no matter your budget, give ourRamseyTrusted agentsa try.

How Can You Get a Mortgage Without a Credit Score?,"While getting a mortgage without a credit score requires more paperwork, it’s not impossible. You just need to find a “no credit mortgage lender” who is willing to do something calledmanual underwriting—like our friends atChurchill Mortgage. Manual underwritingis a hands-on investigation into your ability to repay debt. After all, you’re about to take on a mortgage, and your lender wants to know you can handle it. Here are the steps to take to buy a house with no credit score:"
1. Bring proof of payments.,"The first hoop will be documentation—lots and lots of documentation. You’ll need to show verification of your income for the last 12–24 months, as well as a steady payment history for at least four regular monthly expenses. These expenses may include: The more evidence you can provide of your on-time payment history, the higher your chances of qualifying for your mortgage."
2. Have a big down payment.,"Normally, we recommend a down payment of at least 10–20% of the home price. But if you have no credit score, aim for 20% or more since it reduces the lender’s risk and demonstrates your ability to handle money responsibly."
3. Choose a 15-year fixed-rate conventional mortgage.,"No FHAs. No subprimes. Nothing but a good ol’15-year fixed-rate conventional mortgage. And make sure your monthly mortgage payments are no more than 25% of your monthly take-home pay—including principal, interest,property taxes, home insurance, private mortgage insurance (PMI) and don’t forget to consider homeowners association (HOA) fees. That will keep you from being house poor! This is the only mortgage we ever recommend at Ramsey since it has the overall lowest total cost."
What Exactly Is a Credit Score?,"A credit score is a three-digit number that measures how well you repay debt. In a nutshell, a credit score is an ""I love debt"" score. It says you’ve had debt in the past, and you’ve been tremendous, moderate or awful at paying it back. Three major credit bureaus—TransUnion, Experian and Equifax—use credit-scoring models, like VantageScore and FICO, to come up with a score that ranges from 300–850. But trust us on this—a credit score is not proof of winning financially. Sure, you’ll meet plenty of folks who brag about their credit score like it’s some kind of pick-up line (""on FICO scale, I’m an 850""). Don’t be fooled. A credit score doesn’t measure your wealth, income or employment status—it measures your debt. Credit scores are calculated using five differently weighted debt categories:"
What’s the Difference Between No Credit and Low Credit?,"The quick answer is: Havingnocredit score is good, while alowcredit score is bad. If you have a low credit score, pay off all your debt, don’t miss any bills, and wait until your credit score disappears before trying to buy a house. It’ll be much easier for you to get a mortgage with no credit score than a low one—trust us. "
Other Mortgage Options for No Credit or Low Credit,"When you have no credit or less than stellar credit, lenders will often try talking you into anFHA loan. But don’t fall for it. An FHA loan is a total rip-off—it’s way more expensive than a conventional mortgage. FHA loans were designed by the government to make purchasing a home easier for first-time home buyers or folks who can’t easily qualify for a conventional mortgage. Let’s take a closer look at the pros and cons:"
Pros,"The qualifications on an FHA loan are low—so low, in fact, that if you have no credit history (or a low credit score) and at least a 3.5% down payment, you’ll more than likely qualify."
Cons,"On the surface, FHA loans seem harmless. What could be wrong with a loan program designed to help first-time home buyers buy homes? But underneath the low-entry requirements is a loan that loads you up with massive interest fees and extra mortgage insurance payments that make you pay higher long-term costs.

What Is a Down Payment?,A down payment is a portion of the total home price you pay out of pocket before financing the rest with a mortgage.
How Much Should I Pay for a Down Payment?,"Aim for a down payment that’s 20% or more of the total home price—that’s $40,000 for a $200,000 house. This minimum is partially based on guidelines set by government-sponsored companies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Anything less than 20% is considered riskier for a lender—so to cover their butts, they make the mortgage more expensive for you by adding things like private mortgage insurance (PMI).2 If this isn’t your first time buying a house, you’ve probably built up some serious equity in your current home by paying down your mortgage—and rising home prices have added even more equity. That makes a 20% down payment easier to reach. All you have to do is sell your current home to tap into that equity and—presto!—you have yourself a huge down payment for your next home. If you’re afirst-time home buyer, a smaller down payment of 5–10% is okay too—but then youwillhave to pay that monthly PMI fee."
How Much Does the Average Person Put Down on a House?,"These days, the median down payment is 12%. Not too bad since that’s within our recommended 5–20% range, right? Still, you don’t want to just join the bandwagon because down payment amounts have significantly decreased over time. Not to bore you with a history lesson, but around 30 years ago the median down payment for all buyers was at a much healthier 20%.3 The reasons today’s buyers say they struggle to save a bigger down payment are all debt-related: student loans (51%), credit card debt (45%) and car loans (38%).4That’s why we teach people to pay off 100% of their consumer debt and save a fully funded emergency fund (3–6 months of living expenses) before saving for a house. That way, you’ll have enough room in your budget tosave for a big down payment fasterand have cash to cover unexpected home repairs."
Do YouHaveto Put 20% Down on a House?,"There are ways to buy a house with a down payment less than 20%. We already mentioned how a down payment of 5–10% is doable forfirst-time home buyers. Butbeware!Some mortgage programs allow you to buy a house with a down payment as low as 3.5%—or evennodown payment at all! That may sound tempting on the front end, but don’t be fooled. Anything less than 5–10% is actually a very weak down payment, not to mention a sure-fire way to wind upupside down on a home. And you’ll waste a lot of money in interest and fees over the life of your mortgage."
Is 5–10% Down Enough on a House?,"Remember, if you’re a first-time home buyer, a 5–10% down payment is fine. Keep in mind, any down payment less than 20% will come with that monthly PMI fee, which will increase your monthly mortgage payments. But as long as your mortgage payment is no more than 25% of your monthly take-home pay on a 15-year fixed-rate conventional loan—you’ll be okay. Whatever you do, stay away from FHA and VA loans (more on these next)."
How Low-Down-Payment Mortgages Actually Rip You Off,"“Special” mortgage programs—ones that allow you to put next to nothing down—were designed for people who can’t get approved for a mortgage that meets traditional lending guidelines. But remember, lenders who approve low-down-payment mortgages end up taking more of your money in the long run. So, are they really helping people? We don’t think so. To safeguard yourself, here are some rip-off mortgages to avoid:"
How Does the Size of Your Down Payment Impact Your Mortgage?,"The rule of thumb for down payments is this: A smaller down payment means you spend more on your home—a bigger down payment means you spend less. Why is this true? Because the size of your down payment impacts three things: As an example, imagine you take out a 15-year conventional mortgage at a 4% fixed interest rate on a $200,000 house. Using ourmortgage calculator, let’s find out the total cost difference between a large down payment of 20% versus a small down payment of 3%. (For simplicity, we’ll round our numbers and leave out things like property tax, home insurance and HOA fees for now.)  *Note: If PMI is 1% of the total annual loan amount, the total cost of PMI here would be around $6,500 before it’s cancelled after about four years of mortgage payments, when equity has reached 20%. Notice how putting down 20% on your home, instead of only 3%, allows you to avoid paying $400 extra in monthly mortgage paymentsandaround $6,500 in total PMI fees! Plus, if you use ourmortgage payoff calculator, you can see that making a 20% down payment instead of just 3% saves you more than $11,000 in total interest payments—cha-ching!"
Benefits of a Large Down Payment,"We get it. Saving for a down payment can be one of the most challenging, frustrating parts of buying a house. But patience and perseverance pay off—big time. If you’re saving for a big down payment and haven’t reached your goal yet, don’t stop now. Practice a little delayed gratification. Putting down 20% will be well worth the hard work for five important reasons. Don’t forget: A lower down payment doesn’t save you money. Factor in higher interest rates and hefty fees that come with this mortgage option, and you end up paying more than your home is worth. And that isnevera good idea."
"How Much of a Down Payment Do You Need for a $200,000 House?","To purchase a $200,000 house, you need a down payment of at least $40,000 (20% of the home price) to avoid PMI on a conventional mortgage. If you’re a first-time home buyer, you could save a smaller down payment of $10,000–20,000 (5–10%). But remember, that will drive up your monthly payment with PMI fees. We said it before and we’ll say it again: No matter what, make sure your mortgage payment is no more than 25% of your monthly take-home pay on a 15-year fixed-rate conventional loan. No matter what your down payment is, always follow the 25% rule. Sticking to a monthly payment that’s no more than 25% of your monthly take-home pay can get tricky—but stick with us. As an example, let’s assume you’re buying a $200,000 house with a 15-year mortgage at a 4% fixed interest rate. Your property tax is at 1.1% of the home value, home insurance is $846 per year, and HOA dues are $86 per month. And if your down payment is less than 20%, your PMI is at 0.5% of your loan. Using ourmortgage calculator, you’ll notice that a 20% down payment of $40,000 has you paying $1,523 per month. On the flip side, a 5% down payment of $10,000 has you paying $1,824 per month. In other words, if your monthly take-home pay is at least $6,092, you’d be in good shape to buy a $200,000 house with a 20% down payment because you could afford the $1,523 monthly payments ($6,092 x 25% = $1,523). If your monthly take-home pay is at least $7,296, you could buy a $200,000 house with a 5% down payment because you could afford the $1,824 monthly payments. ($7,296 x 25% = $1,824). Whew—that’s a lot of math! But it’s worth doing so you can feel confident about buying a house you can afford!"

Step 1: Pick Your Projects,"The first step to making a home renovation budget is choosing which projects you want to tackle. Chances are, you can’t afford to refinish your living room floor, replace your kitchen appliances, redo the tile in your bathroomandgive your master bedroom a new paint job. So, it’s time to choose which projects are most important to you. Which projects should you prioritize? Well, if a room in your home is out of whack—as in it’s not functioning the way it should—that should obviously be priority number one. Or if you have a clear vision for how to update a particular space, go for that one first. But if things are otherwise even, start withprojects that will add valueto your home. Think of your renovation project like an investment—you’re trying to get more money out than you put in. Turns out, severalpopular home renovationsended up being great investments for homeowners in 2022. For example, homeowners who refinished their wood floor added enough value to their home to recoup their investment, plus an extra 47%. Folks who installed a completely new wood floor also added more value to their home than they spent on the project—18% extra, to be specific.1 Once you pick the projects you want to focus on, stick to them. It can be tempting to add more tasks along the way, but that’s a surefire way to bust your budget and leave you wondering where all the money went."
Step 2: Research the Costs,"Bust out that calculator—here comes the fun part! Now that you’ve decided which renovations to focus on, research the cost of everything that goes into those projects, including all the labor and materials needed. This’ll take some time and effort, so grab a cup of coffee and get cozy at your computer screen. Keep in mind, you won’t be able to get anexactcost until you talk with actual contractors, but digging around online will give you ballpark figures to help you set a realistic budget. For example, if you’re looking into akitchen renovation, you’ll find numbers similar to these when you research the costs: "
Step 3: Set Your Savings Goal,"Once you get a ballpark estimate for how much your home renovation project will cost, the next step in making a budget is to set a goal for saving up that amount of money. Because if you want to be smart about paying for your renovation project, cash is the only way to go. Sure, you’ve probably heard of fancy financing programs like ahome equity loanor ahome equity line of credit (HELOC), but that means you’d be borrowing moneyagainst your house.Yeah, that’s a terrible idea. No renovation is worth the risk of going further into debt—or even potentially losing your home. That’s why it’s super important to set a savings goal that’ll let you pay for your renovations in cash. How do you do that? It’s simple! Decidewhenyou want to start your project, then do some math (hooray!) to figure out how much money you’ll need to save each month to make it happen. Let’s look at an example: If a couple wanted to completely redo their kitchen for the cost we looked at earlier ($30,000) and they wanted to get started on the project in 18 months, here’s what their savings goals would look like:  Once you set your savings goal, it’s time to get to work. It’s one thing toseta savings goal, but it’s another thing to stick to it. So, make sure you’re tracking your income and spending each month to make sure you stay on track with your goal. For an easy way to do just that, download theEveryDollar app. It’s the best way to keep up with your home renovation budget and track your spending, since thepremium versionlets you connect your bank account—which means all your transactions will automatically pop up in the app. Super easy!"
Step 4: Collect Bids From Contractors,"Once you’ve hit your savings goal and you’re ready to get to work on your dream renovation project, the final step of making a home renovation budget is tohire a home contractor—the person who’ll give you an exact price tag for your project and make sure your renovations actually get done. How do you hire a home contractor? Start by asking around for recommendations or searching online. Try to find at least three legit contractors in your area, then request project bids and timelines from each of them so you can compare pricing. This isn’t all about going with the lowest bid, though. Cheaper isn’t always better if you wind up with a shady contractor who takes several lunch breaks a day and leaves you with a half-finished project. Do your research on potential contractors by checking their insurances and certifications, contacting references and interviewing them yourself. Once you find acontractor you can trustwho fits your price range, bring them on board! When you get to that point, the process ofmakingyour home renovation budget will be complete. That doesn’t mean the work is done, though. You’ll also have to make sure youstick toyour budget. As your project moves ahead, you’ll need to make sure you’re not going over budget on items like appliances, tiling and flooring. Your contractor could also find a problem along the way (like a leak or structural damage) that needs to be fixed—which could mean you need to adjust your plans. You may have to spend some of the money you budgeted to address those issues and cut back on how much you put toward the pretty stuff. But if something unexpected does pop up, you’ll be prepared because you did all the hard work of budgeting on the front end."
How Much Does It Cost to Renovate a House?,"The typical cost to renovate a home is around $10–60 per square foot. So if you renovated a 130-square-foot room, it would cost somewhere between $1,300 and $7,800.3 That might seem like a pretty big range, but the cost of your renovation will depend on the project you tackle, how much work needs to be done, and the materials you choose. And like we talked about earlier, you can get a more specific number by researching the specific renovation project you have in mind. To give you a starting point, here’s a look at how much some common types of renovation projects typically cost:"
Sell Your Home With an Agent Who Knows What to Renovate,"If you’re renovating with the intent to sell your home in the next year, getting advice from a top-notch real estate agent in your area is a good idea.

What Is a Home Equity Line of Credit?,"A home equity line of credit, or HELOC, is a type of home equity loan that allows you to borrow cash against the current value of your home. You can use it for all kinds of purchases up to an approved amount, so it works kind of like a credit card. Also like a credit card, a HELOC uses a revolving credit line, which means that as you pay back what you borrowed, the amount you paid back becomes available for you to spend again. With HELOCs, it’s easy to get stuck in that revolving door of credit and suddenly find yourself in a tight (even critical) financial spot—especially if you’re carrying a high balance."
HELOC vs. Home Equity Loan: What’s the Difference?,"A HELOC is pretty similar to a home equity loan. The main difference is that a home equity loan allows you, the borrower, to take thefulllump sum you’ve been approved for all at once rather than use the charge-as-you-go method of a HELOC. Home equity loans are also more likely to have a fixed interest rate, so your monthly payments are more predictable than they would be with a HELOC, which usually has variable interest rates."
How Does a Home Equity Line of Credit Work?,"How a HELOC works is different from a regular credit card or loan because it uses your home equity as collateral. Your home equity is the portion of your home that you own outright (aka the difference between how much your home is worth and how much you owe on your mortgage). And collateral is thesecurityfor your loan—in other words, it’s the thing you promise to give to the lender if you can’t pay back what you owe. Don’t miss that: A HELOCuses the part of your home that you own as collateral.That means if you can’t pay back the HELOC, the lender can foreclose on your house. Yikes! Now you can see why we don’t recommend HELOCs—because if you get one of these monsters, you’re risking the roof over your head! But just so you can see how it works, let’s pretend you’ve been approved for a HELOC, and your credit line is $40,000. You spend$35,000 updating your kitchen. (Hey there, subway tiles and shiplap.) Now you only have $5,000left to useuntilyou replace what you originally borrowed. Once you pay that $35,000 back, you have $40,000 available to spend again."
What Can You Use a HELOC For?,"You can spend a HELOC on pretty much anything you want. Some common uses are: Those are some really major situations that can either be really exciting or really scary (or both). So we get why it’s tempting to take out a HELOC to try to pay for them. The problem is, a HELOC is debt. So you end up paying for the expensive thing itself,plusthousands of dollars extra in interest. To make things even more stressful, your debt could be called in when you don’t have the money to pay it off—and that can land you in a heap of trouble (more on that in a minute)."
How Long Does It Take to Get a HELOC? (And How Much HELOC Can I Get?),"Once you apply for a HELOC, it can take a few weeks to get approval. A HELOC is a type of second mortgage, so applying for one is similar toapplying for your first mortgage. Lenders will go through a formal process of evaluating your financial situation and home equity to determine if you’re a credit risk or not. They’ll look at your: After verifying these things, lenders will decide how much HELOC you can get. In most cases, borrowers are approved for around 80% of their home’s equity. Let’s say your home is worth $180,000, and you still owe $100,000on your mortgage. You’d have $80,000 inequityyou could potentially access through a HELOC. So you’d likely be approved for a credit line of $64,000, which is around 80% of your equity."
HELOC Closing Costs,"Applying for a HELOC comes with closing costs, just like your mortgage did!1And HELOCs have many of the same up-front costs as a mortgage, includinglender fees. Your lender has to process the HELOC, check your credit, appraise your home, prepare legal documents, andoriginate(aka open) your HELOC account. Lender fees cover those costs—plus a little extra to line the lender’s pocket. And once you’re approved for your HELOC, continuing costs will kick in, like: If you decide to go ahead with a HELOC, you’ll need to read the fine print on your offer statement super closely so you can know exactly what you’re getting into. It will detail all the fees, costs and penalties you could face—and it’ll tell you how to pay back your HELOC."
How Does Paying Back a HELOC Work?,"Well, it doesn’t work in your favor—that’s for sure! Lenders set up HELOC repayment plans sotheycan make money, not make it easy for you. Trying to pay back your HELOC in minimum monthly payments—like most people who use credit cards or credit lines—willnotfill your account back up very quickly, and you’ll end up paying even more ridiculous interest charges! Here are some other important things to know about paying back a HELOC: Repayment:There are a lot of different borrowing and repayment schedules for HELOCs, but most people get a long-term, 30-year repayment option. Yes, 30 years! Do you really want to spend the next 30 years of your life knowing that someone else holds the strings to yourhome? No, thanks! Interest rates:Fixed-rate HELOCs are rare. So you’ll probably have to deal with fluctuating interest rates for the entire life of your credit line. Those rates are basically set by the lender, and they’re definitely not based on the market as we might be led to believe. You could find yourself paying way more interest than you originally expected. Immediate payback:Once your credit term expires,you must paythe balance in full.The same is true if you sell your home. So if you come to the end of the 30 years (or you want to sell your house) and you owe $35,000 on your HELOC, you better be able to cough up that $35,000 immediately. Credit freezes:Even if the loan isn’t expired, the bank can freeze your credit line in some situations, like if your home’s value drops below the amount it was appraised for when you took out the HELOC. That means you can no longer use the HELOC money you were counting on."
Is a HELOC a Good Idea?,"Heck no! A HELOC isnotthe stress-free way to start a new chapter of your life, and it’snota shortcut to get out of debt! And we’re hoping that by now, that HELOC-funded retirement or home remodel or whatever else you had planned doesn’t sound as good as when you first started reading. HELOCs are not the answer to your cash-flow problem. Here’s why—and we’ll tell you therealsolution."
1. You’re putting your home at risk.,"Just because HELOCs seem common doesn’t take away from the fact that they can also carry serious consequences. If you default or misstep in any way,the bank could take your home!Is that new bedroom furniture you justhaveto have or that 10-day vacation really worth losing your home over?"
2. HELOCs don’t really create cash flow.,"Plain and simple, a HELOC is debt. And debt doesn’t make anything flow but tears, because the borrower is slave to the lender. Do you really want to start your retirement, marriage, career or any other big, expensive life event owing money to some company that’s just out to make a buck at your expense? We didn’t think so. The best way to create cash flow is to pay off all your debt using thedebt snowball method. You can also increase your income through asecond joborsmart budgeting. That will generate extra money for things like home improvements, college tuition or your kid’s wedding."
3. Saving and paying cash is way smarter in the long run.,"Taking on debt of any kind robs you of true financial peace.
