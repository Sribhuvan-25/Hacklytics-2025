Now, companies can offer matches based on the amount you pay toward a student loan, rather than what you contribute to your 401(k). Technically, this whole shebang started when former President Joe Biden signed theSECURE 2.0 Actinto law back in 2022.

Then your employer would match that contribution by also putting in $200. But with this new rule, employers have the option of matching yourstudent loanpayments—not just your retirement contributions. So, if you had that same 4% match on a $60,000 salary and you made a student loan payment of at least $200, your employer couldstillput $200 in your 401(k)—even though you didn’t contribute a dime.
